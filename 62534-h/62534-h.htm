<p><span class="smcap">The</span> visit of the Royal Agricultural
Society of England to Chester in July, 1858, seems a fitting
occasion on which to present to the public an entirely <span

has been carefully revised throughout, with the requisite care
and intelligence for securing to strangers a useful memorial of
the &ldquo;old city.&rdquo;&nbsp; The work is also embellished
with a numerous series of engravings, and an illustrated plan,
which will facilitate the visitor&rsquo;s inspection of the
interesting remains and modern attractions with which Chester
abounds; and also supply a pictorial reminiscence of scenes and
places that may perchance excite pleasant memories.&nbsp; In this
hope our Manual is committed to public favour, which, the editor
trusts, will be so heartily manifested, as to require, at no very

<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF CHESTER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Three</span> are but few places, if indeed
there are any, which can present such varied attractions to the
antiquary as this remarkable and ancient city.&nbsp; It is rich
in memorable incidents and associations.&nbsp; It has a history
chronicled not only in books, but in its walls, towers, rows, and
venerable remains.</p>
<p>The origin of Chester is of very remote date.&nbsp; No
definite conclusion has been reached respecting the exact time of
its foundation.&nbsp; Various hypotheses have been started, some
of them grotesque and ridiculous enough, but its origin is lost
in those mists of antiquity where history fades into fable.</p>
<p>It is quite clear, as an authenticated matter of fact, that
Chester was in very early possession of the Romans.&nbsp; It was
the headquarters of the 20th Legion, which, we find, came into
Britain before the year 61; for it had a share in the defeat of
Boadicea by Suetonius.&nbsp; After that important victory this
mighty and intrepid people marched onward towards North Wales,
and established their authority in Cheshire.</p>
<p>Scattered through the city, have been discovered many vestiges
of their power, which enable us to trace their history with
considerable distinctness.&nbsp; Wherever they planted their
settlements, they left permanent records of their greatness and
skill.&nbsp; Many of these memorials have been discovered, in
various parts of the old city; and through the intelligent and
zealous investigations of the Chester Arch&aelig;ological
Society, these antiquities are now made tributary to the
instruction of the inhabitants respecting the history of their
own locality.</p>
<p>Not only to the antiquarian, however, is Chester interesting;
<a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>there is
scarcely any order of mind or taste but may here find its
gratification.&nbsp; Its noble arched bridge, venerable cathedral
and churches, unique rows, and ancient walls encompassing the
city, with a considerable number and variety of relics, all
combine to make Chester an attractive place of resort.&nbsp; It
is the metropolis of the county palatine of that name, and is
pleasantly situated above the river Dee, on a rising
ground.&nbsp; Its names have been various.&nbsp; Its Roman name
was Deva, undoubtedly, because of its being situated on the river
Dee.&nbsp; Then Cestri&aelig;, from Castrum, &ldquo;camp;&rdquo;
and Castrum Legionis, &ldquo;the Camp of the Legion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Its British names were Caer Lleon, &ldquo;the Camp of the
Legion;&rdquo; and Caer Lleon Vawr, or Ddyfrdwy, &ldquo;the Camp
of the Great Legion on the Dee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the brilliant lieutenancy of Julius Agricola, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 85, it became a Roman colony; and
the place was called from them and from its situation, Colonia
Devana.&nbsp; This is clearly demonstrated by a coin of Septimus
Geta, son of Severus, which has this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Col. Devana. Leg. xx.
Victrix.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For two or three centuries after this date, Chester appears to
have continued undisturbed in the power of the Romans; during
which period &ldquo;it was a centre of operations while conquest
was being produced; a centre of civilization and commercial
intercourse when the dominion of the empire was
established.&nbsp; The actual form of the city, its division by
streets into four quarters, exhibits the arrangement which the
Romans established in their camp, and which they naturally
transferred to the cities which took the place of their military
stations.&nbsp; Traces of the work of that wonderful people still
remain on our walls, and on the rocky brows which surround them;
and excite the attention, and reward the diligence of the
antiquarian.&nbsp; Those pigs of lead, the produce of Roman
industry, which are first mentioned, in &lsquo;Camden&rsquo;s
Britannia,&rsquo; as being found in the neighbourhood of Chester,
and two of which have recently been discovered, are memorials of
the early period at which the mineral wealth of this district was
known, and of the commerce to which it gave rise.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
is a fact, clearly established by history, that to the Romans we
are greatly indebted for the introduction of a much higher order
of civilization than that which they found existing when they
took possession of the country.&nbsp; They were the pioneers of
social and religious progress.&nbsp; Previous to the Roman
invasion, the inhabitants were unacquainted with the laws and
arts of civilized life;&mdash;painted their
bodies,&mdash;despised <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>the institution of
marriage,&mdash;clothed themselves in skins,&mdash;knew very
little of agriculture,&mdash;were furious in disposition, and
cruel in their religious superstitions.&nbsp; We find that the
practice of human sacrifices was very general amongst them, and
in every respect their social and moral condition rude and
barbarous in the extreme.&nbsp; So wedded were they to their
idolatrous worship and cruel rites, that the Romans, after their
conquest, found it necessary to abolish their religion by penal
statutes; an exercise of power which was not usual with these
tolerating conquerors.&nbsp; About the year 50, the Emperor
Claudius C&aelig;sar subdued the greater part of Britain, and
received the submission of several of the British states who
inhabited the south-east part of the island.&nbsp; The other
Britons, under the command of Caractacus, still maintained an
obstinate resistance, and the Romans made little progress against
them until Ostorius Scapula was sent over, in the year 50, to
command their armies.&nbsp; This renowned general found the
country in a state of great excitement and dissatisfaction, but
speedily advanced the Roman conquests over the
Britons&mdash;defeated Caractacus in a great battle&mdash;took
him prisoner, and sent him to Rome&mdash;where his magnanimous
behaviour procured him better treatment than those conquerors
usually bestowed on native princes.&nbsp; He pardoned Caractacus
and his family, and commanded that their chains should
immediately be taken off.</p>
<p>Holinshed is of opinion that Ostorius Scapula was the founder
of Chester, and the reasons he adduces are certainly very
plausible.&nbsp; He says, &ldquo;It is not unlike that it might
be first built by P. Ostorius Scapula, who, as we find, after he
had subdued Caractacus, King of the Ordonices, that inhabited the
countries now called Lancashire, Cheshire, and Salopshire, built
in those parts, and among the Silures, certeine places of
defense, for the better harbrough of his men of warre, and
keeping downe of such Britaines as were still readie to move
rebellion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Passing over the space of a few years, we find Julius Agricola
completing the conquest of this island.&nbsp; Such was his
formidable power and skilful policy in governing the people, that
we are told they soon became reconciled to the supremacy of the
Roman arms and language.&nbsp; He quelled their animosity to the
Roman yoke, and certainly did very much for the progress of the
people in civilization, knowledge, and the arts of peace.</p>
<p>There is perhaps no place in the kingdom that can boast of so
many monuments of Roman skill and ingenuity as Chester; but as <a
name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>these will be
described in detail as we proceed, we need not specify them
here.</p>
<p>About the year 448 the Romans withdrew from the island, after
having been masters of the most considerable part of its
territory for nearly four centuries, and left the Britons to arm
for their own defence.&nbsp; No sooner, however, had the Romans
withdrawn their troops, than the Scots and Picts invaded the
country with their terrible forces, and spread devastation and
ruin along the line of their march.&nbsp; These vindictive and
rapacious barbarians, fired with the lust of conquest, made a
pitiless onslaught upon the property and lives of the
people.&nbsp; The unhappy Britons petitioned, without effect, for
the interposition of Rome, which had declared its resolution for
ever to abandon them.&nbsp; The British ambassadors were
entrusted with a letter to the legate at Rome, pathetically
stating their perilous dilemma, and invoking their immediate
aid.</p>
<p>The intestine commotions which were then shaking the Roman
empire to its centre prevented the masters of the then world from
affording the timely aid sought at their hands.</p>
<p>Despairing of any reinforcement from Rome, the Britons now
invoked the aid of the Saxons, who promptly complied with the
invitation, and under Hengist and Horsa, two Saxon chiefs, who
were also brothers, wrested Chester from the hands of the
invaders.&nbsp; The Saxons, perceiving the weakness of their
degenerate allies, soon began to entertain the project of
conquering them, and seizing the country as their spoil.&nbsp;
During the conflict which ensued between the Britons and Saxons,
who from allies became masters.&nbsp; Chester was frequently
taken and retaken, and suffered severely in various sieges.&nbsp;
Ultimately, the Aborigines were totally subjugated under the
mightier sway of Saxon arms.</p>
<p>In 607 Ethelfrid, King of Northumbria, waged a sanguinary
battle with the Britons under the walls of Chester, whom he
defeated.</p>
<p>It is recorded that he came to avenge the quarrel of St.
Augustine, whose metropolitan jurisdiction the British monks
refused to admit.&nbsp; Augustine is said to have denounced
against them the vengeance of heaven, for this reason, three
years previously.</p>
<p>Sammes, in his Antiquities of Britain, gives an interesting
statement of this celebrated battle: &ldquo;Edelfrid, the
strongest King of the English, having gathered together a great
army about the city of Chester, he made a great slaughter of that
nation; but when he was going to give the onset, he espied
priests and others, who were <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>come thither to entreat God for the
success of the army, standing apart in a place of advantage; he
asked who they were, and for what purpose they had met
there?&nbsp; When Edelfrid had understood the cause of their
coming, he said, &lsquo;If, therefore, they cry unto their God
against us, certainly they, although they bear no arms, fight
against us, who prosecute us by their prayers.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The victory was not destined, however, to be an abiding
one.&nbsp; The supremacy of Ethelfrid over the Britons was not
long in duration.&nbsp; History tells us that a few years after
he had achieved his conquest, the united forces of Brocmail and
three other British princes rescued from his hands the possession
of Chester, and put his armies to flight.&nbsp; In 613, the
Britons assembled in Chester, and elected Cadwon their king, who
reigned with great honour for twenty-two years.</p>
<p>From this period to the close of the Heptarchy, we have but
very scanty materials respecting the history of Chester.&nbsp;
The Britons appear to have retained possession of it until about
the year 828, when it was finally taken by Egbert, during the
reign of the British prince Mervyn and his wife Esylht.</p>
<p>In a few years afterwards (894 or 895) the city underwent a
heavy calamity, from its invasion by Harold, King of the Danes,
Mancolin, King of the Scots, and another confederate prince, who
are said to have encamped on Hoole heath, near Chester, and,
after a long siege, reduced the city.&nbsp; These predatory
pirates were soon after attacked and conquered by Alfred, who
utterly routed them from the military defences in which they had
embosomed themselves, and destroyed all the cattle and corn of
the district.</p>
<p>After the evacuation of the city by the Danes, it remained in
ruins until about the year 908, when it was restored by Ethelred,
the first Earl of Mercia, and Ethelfleda, his wife, who, it is
said, enlarged it to double the extent of the Roman town.&nbsp;
Sir Peter Leycester says that &ldquo;Ethelred and his countess
restored Caerleon, that is Legecestria, now called Chester, after
it was destroyed by the Danes, and enclosed it with new walls,
and made it nigh such two as it was before; so that the castle
that was sometime by the water without the walls, is now in the
town within the walls.&rdquo;&nbsp; All the narratives which have
been handed down to us of this celebrated woman represent her as
possessed of incomparable talent, great enterprise, and pure
mind.&nbsp; She employed the great power and opportunity she
possessed with admirable wisdom, and made them subservient to
acts of munificence and piety.&nbsp; She died at <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>Tamworth in
922, whence her body was translated to Gloucester.&nbsp;
Leycester gives a lengthy record of her good deeds, which
prepares us for the fact that her loss was deeply and universally
regretted throughout the whole kingdom.</p>

<p>The security of Chester against the Danish invaders was
ultimately effected by the victories of Edmund, in or about 942,
after which it was occasionally honoured by the residence of the
Saxon sovereigns.&nbsp; Pennant says, King Edgar made this one of
the stations in his annual circumnavigation of his
dominions.&nbsp; About the year 973, he visited Chester, attended
by his court, and received the homage of his vassal kings.&nbsp;
It is said that one day entering his barge, he assumed the helm,
and made his eight tributary princes row him from the palace
which stood in the field at Handbridge, opposite the castle (and
which still bears his name), up the river Dee, as far as the
monastery of St. John&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In the following century
Chester was possessed by the Earls of Mercia, until the Norman
Conquest in 1066.&nbsp; The tyranny, violence, and bloodshed
which marked the course of William the Conqueror, met with
determined resistance in various parts of the country; but in the
course of six or seven years he utterly crushed all opposition,
and became absolute master of the island.&nbsp; He introduced
into England the feudal system, &ldquo;with its military
aristocracy, its pride, its splendour, and its iron
dominion.&nbsp; The importance of Chester, as a military station,
was shown by its being assigned as a fief to one of the chief
leaders in the Norman army, and on his death by its being given
to the nephew of the Duke himself, under whom it was invested
with privileges which raised it almost to the rank of a separate
principality.&nbsp; Under Hugh, the first Earl of Chester, and
his immediate successors, we may suppose that most of those
castles were built, which form objects of antiquarian research in
the neighbourhood, but which are melancholy records of the state
of society at the time, since they were evidently built to
protect the frontiers from the continued invasions of the
Welsh.&nbsp; Some of these still remain, and, from their extent
and magnificence, appear to have been the residences of the Earls
themselves.&nbsp; Many more have perished, and can only be traced
by the banks which mark the outline of their plan.&nbsp; These
were probably of an inferior description, and are rather to be
considered as guard-houses for the protection of some particular
pass than as regular fortresses.&nbsp; There are traces of this
kind at Doddleston, at Pulford, at Aldford, at Holt, at Shotwick,
beside the larger and more distinguished holds <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>at Beeston,
Halton, Chester, and Hawarden; and probably few years passed but
that some inroad of the Welsh carried fire and slaughter to the
very gates of Chester, and swept the cattle and produce from the
fields.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
<p>For many years previous to the Norman Conquest, Chester was
governed by Dukes or Earls; but William, perceiving the danger of
entrusting so large a territory in the hands of any one of his
barons, curtailed the provinces within narrower limits, and
thereby crippled the power which had often proved dangerous to
the throne, and at the same time augmented his own, by having a
larger number of gifts and emoluments to bestow on his
followers.&nbsp; In the first instance, William gave Chester to
Gherbodus, a noble Fleming, who, having obtained permission of
the king to visit Flanders for the transaction of some private
business, there fell into the hands of his enemies, and was
obliged to resign the earldom to Hugh Lupus, the nephew of the
Conqueror, who was appointed in his stead.&nbsp; The Earldom was
now erected into a Palatinate.&nbsp; Camden says, &ldquo;William
the 1st created Hugh, surnamed Lupus, the first Earl of Chester
and Count Palatine, and gave unto him and his heirs all the
county, to be holden as freely by the sword as the king himself
held England by his crown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By reason of this grant, the Earls of Chester were invested
with sovereign jurisdiction, and held their own
parliaments.&nbsp; It is supposed that Lupus was invested with
his new dignity at Chester by William himself, when he was
present there in person in 1069.</p>
<p>He created several barons to assist him in his council and
government, some of whom we find upon record, as Nigel, Baron of
Halton; Sir William Maldebeng, of Malbanc, Baron of Witch
Malbanc, or Nantwich; Richard de Vernon, Baron of Shipbroke;
Gilbert Venables, Baron of Kinderton; Hamon de Massey, Baron of
Dunham Massey; Warren de Poynton, Baron of Stockport; Eustace de
Monthalt, Baron of Monthalt.&nbsp; He converted the church of St.
Werburgh into an abbey, by the advice of St. Anselm.</p>
<p>He continued Earl thirty-one years, died the 27th of July,
1101, and was buried in the churchyard, but afterwards removed to
the present Chapter-house of the Cathedral, where his body was
found in 1724, wrapped in leather, enclosed in a stone
coffin.</p>
<p>His Sword of Dignity forms one of the many valuable
curiosities <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>preserved in the British Museum.&nbsp; His parliament was
formed of eight barons, who were obliged to attend him.&nbsp;
Every baron had four esquires, every esquire one gentleman, and
every gentleman one valet.&nbsp; The barons had the power of life
and death.&nbsp; Hugh Lupus was succeeded by his son Richard, who
was drowned in his passage from Normandy.&nbsp; He governed
nineteen years, and was succeeded by Ranulph, surnamed
<i>Mechines</i>, son of Margaret, sister to Lupus.&nbsp; Ranulph
died at Chester, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1129, <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a> and was succeeded by the heroic Ranulph
II., surnamed <i>Geronjis</i>, who, having held the earldom
twenty-five years, was poisoned in 1153, and was buried at
Chester.</p>
<p>Hugh II., his son, surnamed Cyvelioc, succeeded him, and
continued in the earldom twenty-eight years.&nbsp; He died at
Leek, in Staffordshire, and was buried at Chester.</p>
<p>Hugh was succeeded by his son Ranulph, surnamed
<i>Blundeville</i>, who, for his benevolence, was styled
<i>Ranulph the Good</i>.&nbsp; He served in the holy wars, and
was as celebrated as any of the Seven Champions of
Christendom.&nbsp; After his return, he built Beeston Castle, in
Cheshire, a noble and imposing fortress, which, before the use of
fire-arms, might have been deemed impregnable.&nbsp; It is built
on an insulated rock, and its summit is one hundred yards above
the level of the brook that runs at its base.&nbsp; It endured
three sieges during the civil wars.&nbsp; The middle part of the
slope is surrounded by towers, which time, however, has
dismantled; the well in the upper part was cut through the rock
to the depth of one hundred yards; in the course of time it
became nearly filled up with rubbish, but within the last few
years was cleared, built round, and enclosed, by J. Tollemache,
Esq., M.P., to whom the castle belongs.&nbsp; It is ten miles
distant from Chester, on the London and North-Western
Railway.</p>
<p>This Earl Ranulph was besieged by the Welsh in the castle of
Rhuddlan, and was relieved by Ralph Dutton, son-in-law of Roger
Lacy, Constable of Chester, at the head of a large body of
fiddlers, minstrels, &amp;c., who were then assembled at the fair
of Hugh Lupus.&nbsp; A remarkable privilege of this fair was,
that no thief or malefactor that attended it should be attached
or punished, except for offences then and there committed.&nbsp;
With this motley crew Dutton marched into Wales, and raised the
siege; for which Ranulph rewarded him <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>with full power over all the
instruments of his preservation, and the privilege of licensing
the minstrels.&nbsp; The anniversary of this achievement was
formerly celebrated on the festival of St. John the Baptist, by a
regular procession of the minstrels to the church of their
tutelar saint, St. Werburgh, in honour of whom Hugh Lupus granted
to the minstrels, &amp;c., the above-mentioned privilege, which
is recognized in all subsequent vagrant acts, by a special
exception in favour of the minstrel jurisdiction of the Duttons,
of Dutton, in Cheshire.&nbsp; The last Earl Ranulph died in 1232,
and was buried at Chester.</p>
<p>John Scott succeeded Ranulph, who died without issue; not
without suspicion, Leycester says, of being poisoned by the
contrivance of Helene his wife.</p>
<p>The Earls of Chester continued to exercise their local
sovereignty for about one hundred and sixty years.&nbsp; They
held that sovereignty, it is true, as the representatives of the
paramount sovereignty of the King of England, and as owing
allegiance to him in all things; but so far as the government of
the Palatinate was concerned, their rule, though nominally
mediate, was actually absolute, for the King does not appear to
have thwarted their jurisdiction, or in any way to have exerted
his supreme authority, beyond retaining a mint at Chester.</p>
<p>After the death of the seventh Earl, in 1237, Henry the Third
united the Earldom to the Crown; he afterwards conferred it upon
his eldest son, Prince Edward, about <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1245, who, two years after this,
received the homage of his military tenants at Chester.&nbsp;
From that period to the present the title of Earl of Chester has
been vested in the eldest son of the reigning sovereign, and is
now held by His Royal Highness Albert, Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>In 1255 Llewellyn ap Gryffid, Prince of Wales, provoked by the
cruel injuries his subjects had received from Geffrey Langley,
Lieutenant of the County under Prince Edward, carried fire and
sword to the gates of Chester.&nbsp; In 1257 Henry the Third
summoned his nobility and bishops to attend, with their vassals,
at Chester, in order to invade Wales; and in 1275 Edward the
First appointed the city as the place for Llewellyn to do him
homage, whose refusal ended with the ruin of himself and his
principality; for in 1300 Edward of Carnarvon here received the
final acknowledgment of the Welsh to the sovereignty of England;
and in a few years afterwards, Llewellyn was brought hither a
prisoner from Flint Castle.&nbsp; Richard the Second visited this
his favourite <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>city in 1397, and in 1399 he was brought a prisoner from
Flint Castle to the castle of Chester, which Bolingbroke,
afterwards Henry the Fourth, had seized.</p>
<p>In Owen Glendower&rsquo;s wars this city was a <i>place
d&rsquo;armes</i> for the English troops in the expeditions
against the Welsh, who, ever tenacious of their independence,
were as unwilling to submit to the Norman as the Saxon yoke.</p>
<p>In 1459 Henry the Sixth, with Queen Margaret and her son
Edward, visited Chester, and bestowed little silver swans on the
Cheshire gentlemen who espoused her cause.</p>
<p>It appears that Henry the Seventh and his Queen also visited
Chester in 1493.&nbsp; In 1554 George Marsh, the pious martyr was
publicly burnt at Boughton, for his steadfast adherence to the
Protestant faith.&nbsp; In the year 1617 the city was honoured
with the presence of James the First, when Edward Button, the
then Mayor, presented the King with a gilt cup containing one
hundred jacobuses of gold.</p>
<p>From this time no event of any great importance appears to
have transpired, until the city was involved in the calamities of
a siege, in consequence of its loyalty to Charles the
First.&nbsp; The city stood the siege for some months; but the
inhabitants at last, reduced to the extremity of famine, so that
they were compelled to eat horses, dogs, cats, and other animals,
abandoned their resistance, made honourable terms of
capitulation, and yielded the city on February the 3rd,
1645&ndash;6.</p>
<p>Chester was, probably, in the time of the Romans, or earlier,
a thriving port.&nbsp; The Saxon navy was stationed here, and it
was also the seat of the Mercian kings.&nbsp; About the time of
the Conquest the imports and exports appear to have been
considerable.&nbsp; But as an illustration of the times we may
mention, that one article of the latter was slaves, obtained, it
is conjectured, from the captives which were made in the frequent
wars with the Welsh.&nbsp; It is quite clear that Chester was, in
ancient days, a busy and nourishing port, because of the
perfectly navigable condition of the Dee.&nbsp; All the early
writers of its history unite in bearing testimony to this
point.&nbsp; It may here be mentioned as a curious and
interesting fact, that some centuries ago, Flookersbrook was
covered with water, and that a deep and broad channel flowed
through Mollington, Stanney, and that direction, which emptied
itself into the estuary now called the Mersey.&nbsp; Holinshed,
after tracing minutely the course of the Dee through
Flookersbrook up <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>to Stanney, distinctly states that it &ldquo;sendeth
foorth one arme by Stannie Poole, and the Parke side into Merseie
arme,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; Speed distinctly marks out this course
in his map; and it is still more broadly defined in an old Dutch
map, of a much earlier date, printed at Rotterdam.</p>
<p>In consequence of the uncertain and imperfect state of the
river, the once thriving commerce of this ancient port has
dwindled into comparative insignificance, and Liverpool has
reaped the advantage.&nbsp; Spirited efforts have latterly been
made to improve the navigation and port of Chester.</p>
<p>With regard to the ecclesiastical history of Chester, it may
suffice to observe that, according to King&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vale
Royal,&rsquo; Theodore, the first Anglo-Saxon Primate, ordained
at Rome in 669, appointed St. Chad the first Bishop of Chester,
who fixed his seat at Lichfield.&nbsp; &ldquo;After him one
Winifred was bishop, who, for his disobedience in some points,
was deprived by Theodore, who appointed in his place one
Sexulph.&nbsp; The said Theodore, by authority of a synod held at
Hatfield, did divide the province of Mercia into five bishoprics,
that is to say, Chester, Worcester, Lichfield, Cederna in
Lindsey, and Dorchester, which after was translated to
Lincoln.&nbsp; After Sexulf, one Aldwin was Bishop of Lichfield,
and next to him Eudulfus, who was adorned with the
Archbishop&rsquo;s pall, having all the bishops under King
Offa&rsquo;s dominions suffragans to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The diocese of Chester seems to have continued one with that
of Lichfield to the time of the Conquest, when Pennant says a
Bishop of Lichfield, in the year 1075, removed his episcopal seat
to Chester, and during his life made use of the monastery of St.
John&rsquo;s for his cathedral.</p>
<p>His successor was Robert of Lindsey, chaplain of Wm. Rufus,
who removed the see to Coventry; St. John&rsquo;s church,
however, continued collegiate up to the time of the Reformation,
at which period it had a dean, eight canons or prebends, and ten
vicars choral.&nbsp; The prelate and his successors, although
having seats at Lichfield and Coventry, as well as Chester,
continued to have the designation of Bishop of Chester, until the
appointment of John Ketterich, in 1415, who was not so styled,
nor any of his successors until the time of the
Reformation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The bishops that were before that time
(although they were commonly called Bishops of Chester) were
Bishops of Lichfield, and had but their seat or most abiding <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>in
Chester.&rdquo;&nbsp; Henry the Eighth erected Chester into a
distinct diocese in the 33rd year of his reign, &ldquo;turning
the monastery of St. Werburgh into the Bishop&rsquo;s palace;
unto which jurisdiction was allotted Cheshire, Lancashire,
Richmondshire, and part of Cumberland; and was appointed to be
within the province of York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Bird, D.D., &ldquo;formerly a fryer of the order of the
Carmelites, was the first bishop of this new
foundation.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was deprived of his bishopric by
Queen Mary, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1544, because of
his adhesion to the Protestant faith.&nbsp; He was succeeded by
George Cotes, who survived his consecration only about two
years.&nbsp; He died at Chester, and was buried in the Cathedral
near the Bishop&rsquo;s throne.&nbsp; His memory is stained with
the blood of George Marsh, who, during his episcopate, suffered
martyrdom at Boughton.&nbsp; The next Bishop was Cuthbert Scott,
who was vice-chancellor of Oxford in 1554 and 1555, one of the
delegates commissioned by Cardinal Pole to visit that University,
and one of the four Bishops who, with as many divines, undertook
to defend the Church of Rome against an equal number of reformed
divines.&nbsp; He was deposed by Queen Elizabeth, for some
abusive expressions uttered against Her Majesty.&nbsp; William
Downham, chaplain to Queen Elizabeth before she came to the
crown, was consecrated Bishop of Chester, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1561.&nbsp; He died Nov., 1577, and
was buried in the choir of the Cathedral, having sat Bishop
sixteen years and a half: from that time to the present there has
been a regular succession of Bishops of the Reformed Church.</p>
<p>John Graham, D.D., formerly Master of Christ&rsquo;s College,
Cambridge, was consecrated to the see of Chester in 1848, in
succession to the present Archbishop of Canterbury, and is at
present fulfilling the duties of his high office with pious
earnestness, diligence, and general approbation.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Municipal institutions were first introduced into Britain by
the Romans.&nbsp; York was one of the first towns in England on
which they were conferred.&nbsp; We can discover very little to
aid us in tracing the progressive history of the municipal
government of the ancient city of Chester until the time of
Ranulph, the third Earl Palatine, and nephew of the Earl Hugh;
but being a Roman colony, the inhabitants no doubt were regarded
as Roman citizens, and as such entitled to the same privileges
which Rome itself possessed.&nbsp; Pennant supposes that the
Roman pr&aelig;torium occupied <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>the site on which St. Peter&rsquo;s
church is now built.&nbsp; In this tribunal, if the case be so,
the civil law and power would be exercised in those days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before the city had any charter,&rdquo; says
King&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vale Royal,&rsquo; &ldquo;they used by
prescription divers liberties, and enjoyed a guild mercatory,
that is, a brotherhood of merchants, and that whosoever was not
admitted of that society, he could not use any trade or traffick
within the city, nor be a tradesman therein.&nbsp; And the tenor
of this guild mercatory did even run in these
words:&mdash;&lsquo;Sicut hactenus usi fuerint;&rsquo; and was
after confirmed under the Earl&rsquo;s seal.&nbsp; And there were
appointed two overseers, and those were appointed out of the
chiefest of the citizens, and were greatly respected of the
citizens as officers that had the special care of maintaining
those privileges, before a mayor was ordained.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
officers were elected annually, and were denominated
leave-lookers; they were accustomed to go round the city to see
that its privileges were preserved, and sometimes used to take
small sums, called <i>leave-lookerage</i>, for <i>leave</i> for
non-freemen to sell wares by retail.</p>
<p>In the reign of Edward the Confessor, the government of the
city was vested in twelve judges, selected from the vassals of
the king, the earl, and the bishop.</p>
<p>The first charter granted to the city was by the first
Ranulph, also styled Ranulph le Meschin, third Earl of Chester,
who died in 1128.&nbsp; It grants to his tenants demesne of
Chester, that none but they or their heirs shall buy or sell
merchandise, brought to the city by sea or land, except at the
fairs holden at the nativity of St. John the Baptist, and on the
feast of St. Michael; and is directed thus&mdash;Ranul. com.
Cestr&aelig;. constabulario. dupifero justiciar, vicecom. baron.
militibus bullivis et omnibus servientibus suis pr&aelig;sentibus
et futuris, salutem; Sciatis, &amp;c.; and so makes a large grant
to the city, and warrants the same strongly against his heirs,
and appoints forfeitures upon all that shall withstand.&nbsp; The
charter, which is without date, is witnessed by Domino Hugone,
Abbate Cestri&aelig;.&nbsp; Domino Hugone le Orebi, tunc.
justiciar.&nbsp; Warren de Vernon, &amp;c., &amp;c.&nbsp; It was
confirmed by the other two Earls Ranulphs, and also by Earl John,
who strictly prohibited all buying and selling except as
aforesaid, with other additions.&nbsp; King John and Henry the
Second also established it, with the addition of some further
privileges.&nbsp; Henry the Third granted three charters, in the
first of which he recites, that he hath seen the former charters
of the Earls, and doth grant and confirm <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>domesticis
hominibus Cestr. &amp;c., that none shall buy or sell merchandise
in the city, but citizens, except in the fairs, &amp;c., sub
p&oelig;na &pound;10.</p>
<p>It was at this time that, so far as we can ascertain, the
first mayor was created. <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a>&nbsp; In the 26th
year of Henry&rsquo;s reign, Sir Walter Lynnet was the first who
was invested with civic honours and authority.&nbsp; The
mayoralty of Chester is, therefore, a very ancient one, only 58
years younger, we believe, than that of London.</p>
<p>In 1300 Edward the First confirmed the former charter of his
father, Henry the Third; and by the same charter gave the city of
Chester, with the appurtenances, liberties, and freedoms to the
citizens of Chester and their heirs, to be holden of him and his
heirs for ever, paying yearly &pound;100.&nbsp; He granted them
also the election of coroners and pleas of the crown, and that
the citizens shall have sock, sack, toll, theme, irfangtheof,
outfangtheof, and to be free throughout all the land and dominion
of toll, passage, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Many other charters follow, and other matters connected with
the government of the city.</p>
<p>Richard the Second, in 1347, &ldquo;for the furtherance of
justice and better execution thereof, grants unto his subjects,
maiors, sheriffs, and commonality of the said city, to hold their
courts; and limited what processes they may award in actions,
personal felonies, appeals, process of uttagary, as at the common
law;&rdquo; and since then the sessions of the peace have
continued to be held down to the present time.</p>
<p>Henry Seventh, &ldquo;in consideration that through the decay
of the haven and river, by many burstings forth, was become sandy
and impassable, as before, for merchandise,&rdquo; remitteth
&pound;80 annually of the fee farm rent.&nbsp; And the said King
Henry Seventh granteth that the city of Chester and the suburbs,
towns, and hamlets thereof, the castle excepted, should be a
county of itself, by the name of the county of Chester.</p>
<p>Henry the Eighth sent letters in parchment under his privy
seal to the Mayor of Chester, charging that the citizens should
not be pressed unto the war, but remain within the city for the
defence thereof.&nbsp; He also, by letters patent, discharged the
city from being a sanctuary for malefactors, which was by
proclamation removed to Stafford.&nbsp; In the 32nd year of the
same reign, the city obtained <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the privilege of returning two
burgesses as its representatives in the English parliament.</p>
<p>The important changes effected in the municipal corporations
of England and Wales in 1835 render it unnecessary to enter
further into the various charters granted to the city of
Chester.&nbsp; By that Act, the local government was vested in
town councillors, elected by the burgesses, and who serve for a
term of three years.&nbsp; Chester is divided into five wards for
the election of the council; each ward elects six councillors,
two of whom retire from office annually.&nbsp; The councillors
elect ten aldermen, who hold their office for six years; and any
member of the council is eligible to the office of mayor.</p>

mayor of Chester:&mdash;</p>

ROMAN ANTIQUITIES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Altars</span>, Roman pavements, pigs of
lead, coins, and other precious relics of former times, have been
discovered in various places in the city and neighbourhood, some
of them within a very recent period.&nbsp; Now that the people
are happily being taught to estimate local antiquities at their
proper worth, and a spirit of inquiry is being invoked respecting
them, it is to be hoped that any future discoveries that may be
made will be carefully preserved.&nbsp; There is no doubt that,
through recklessness or ignorance, many links in the chain of our
local history have been neglected and lost.</p>
<p>On a projecting rock in Handbridge, situate at the south end
of the bridge, is a sculptured figure of Minerva, with her
symbol, the owl.&nbsp; Time has very much obliterated and defaced
this ancient sculpture, called Edgar&rsquo;s Cave, which is
doubtless of Roman date.&nbsp; Close to the figure is a great
hole in the rock; and the field in which it is situated is known
by the name of Edgar&rsquo;s field to the present day.</p>
<p>In the year 1653 an altar, supposed to have been dedicated to
Jupiter, was dug up in Foregate-street, and which is preserved
among the Arundelian marbles at Oxford.&nbsp; The back of it is
plain: on the sides of it there are neatly sculptured a Patera, a
cup which was used in their libations; and a Thuribulum, or
censer for burning incense.&nbsp; The inscription, when perfect,
was&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">I . O . M . TANARO<br

</blockquote>
<p>which Leigh, in his &lsquo;Natural History of Lancashire and
Cheshire,&rsquo; explains thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><a

</blockquote>
<p>In the year 1693, on the occasion of digging a place for a
cellar in Eastgate-street, an altar was found buried amongst a
great quantity of ashes, horns, and bones of several
animals.&nbsp; On the back of the altar is represented a curtain
with a festoon, over which is a globe surrounded with palm
branches.&nbsp; On one side is a vase with two handles, from
which issue acanthus leaves, supporting a basket of fruit; on the
other side is a Genius with a Cornucopia in his left hand, and an
altar on his right: on the top of the altar is a well sculptured
human face within the Thuribulum.</p>
<p>This altar was found with the inscription downwards, and near
it were two medals, one of Vespasian, the other is assigned to
Constantius Chlorus, son-in-law of Maximian.&nbsp; The
inscription, with restorations, runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">PRO . SAL . DOMIN<br />

</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Roach Smith says, &ldquo;The persons who erected this
altar were of Samosata, a town of Syria, celebrated as the
birth-place of Lucian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1779 an altar was found in Watergate-street, which is still
preserved in the grounds of Oulton Park, the seat of Sir Philip
de Malpas Grey Egerton, Bart, M.P.: at the sides are the rod of
Esculapius, the Cornucopi&aelig; and rudder, a patera, urn,
sacrificial knife, and other instruments.&nbsp; The inscription,
with a few restorations, is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">FORTVNAE . REDVCI<br />

</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>In the
year 1821 a handsome altar was found by some labourers in a field
called &ldquo;The Daniels,&rdquo; in Great Boughton, near
Chester, between the Tarvin and Huntingdon roads: it is now
preserved at Eaton Hall, the seat of the Marquis of
Westminster.&nbsp; It is of red sandstone; the mouldings are
bold, but it has no other ornaments upon it except the scrolls
which support the Thuribulum.&nbsp; The inscription is the same
on both sides, and is as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">NYMPHIS<br />
ET<br />
FONTIBVS<br />
LEG XX.<br />
V V</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has been supposed that the reason why this altar was
erected on that particular spot, was because of the pure water
which springs on that side of the town: the old Abbot&rsquo;s
well is in that quarter, whence water was formerly conveyed by
pipes to some of the monasteries in Chester.</p>
<p>In 1729, in digging a cellar in Watergate-street, a stone was
found with an inscription, of which the following fragment only
remains:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">NVMINI . AVG<br />
ALMAE . CET<br />
NVS . ACTOR<br />
EX . VOTO . FACI</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Chapter-house of Chester Cathedral, there is a red
sandstone, 24 inches by 8 inches, found on the site of the
Deanery, bearing this inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">COH . I . E. OCRATI<br
/>
MAXIMINI . M . P</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Roach Smith, an eminent authority in such matters, says
that this inscription is to be ascribed to the century of
Ocratius Maximus, of the first Cohort of the 20th Legion: it has
evidently been a facing stone, probably in the city wall; it
resembles in character the centurial commemorations on the stones
in the great northern wall, and, like them, apparently refers to
the completion of a certain quantity of building.</p>
<p>In the year 1738, in digging the foundation of a house in the
market-place, a fragment of a slate stone was found, on which was
cut in bas-relief, the figure of a Retiarius armed with his
trident and net, and a considerable part of the shield of the
Secutor.&nbsp; The Secutores and the Retiarii were gladiators,
distinguished by their armour and manner of fighting.&nbsp; They
bore in their left hand a <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>trident, and in the right a net, with
which the combatant attempted to entangle his adversary, by
throwing it over his head, and suddenly drawing it together, and
then with his trident he usually slew him.</p>
<p>Horsley describes a small statue of stone found near the Dee,
supposed to be either Atys or Mithras.&nbsp; It had a Phrygian
bonnet, a mantle on the shoulders, a short vest on the body, and
a declining torch in the hands.</p>
<p>On pulling down the old Eastgate in 1768, some portions of the
original Roman structure were discovered, consisting of four
arches, two in a line, and fifteen feet distant from each other;
between the two arches fronting the east was a statue of the god
Mars, holding in his right hand a spear handle, and his left
resting on a shield.&nbsp; This was cut in one large stone, of
about a half ton weight.&nbsp; There was also found a piece of
rude sculpture about two feet in height, representing a Roman
soldier.</p>
<p>In the year 1800 a Roman Ring, with an onyx stone in the
centre, was found by some workmen when digging in a garden in
Upper Northgate-street, and is now in the possession of R. J.
Hastings, Esq., of Chester.</p>
<p>In 1803 part of a mosaic pavement, about five feet square, was
discovered about six feet below the surface of the earth, on
digging a cellar in what was then known by the name of the
Nun&rsquo;s Garden, near the Castle.</p>
<p>In 1813 in sinking the foundation of a cellar at Netherleigh
House, a short distance from Chester, a considerable number of
large vases of red clay were discovered; they were regularly
arranged in vaults, each vault containing four or six
vases.&nbsp; Some of these were filled with calcined bones and
small lumps of white clay.&nbsp; One of the vases was secured in
a perfect state, but the others in most part were destroyed,
through the carelessness of the workmen.&nbsp; A demi-figure,
habited in a sacerdotal costume, was found at the same time.</p>
<p>In 1814 a tesselated pavement was discovered near the gateway
of the Castle, in making the alterations there, part of which was
destroyed, and the remainder covered up again.</p>
<p>In April, 1850, whilst excavating for a drain on the premises
belonging to Mr. Wynne, carpenter, on the east side of
Bridge-street, adjoining the Feathers-lane, a portion of a tile
flooring, of medi&aelig;val construction, was discovered, in a
remarkably good state of preservation.&nbsp; This floor was made
the subject of a lecture by <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Mr. Harrison, architect, which is
embodied in the reports published by the Chester
Arch&aelig;ological Society.&nbsp; Large square Roman tiles of
red clay are frequently found in removing old buildings, and
breaking up the pavements, in Chester.&nbsp; Many of these are
stamped with the inscription of the 20th Legion, <span
class="GutSmall">LEG. XX. VV.</span>, and others are marked,
<span class="GutSmall">LEG. VV. &OElig;</span>.</p>
<p>These tiles were manufactured by the soldiers of the Legion,
who were accomplished masons, being trained to use the pickaxe,
spade, and trowel, as well as military arms.&nbsp; In times of
peace they were employed in building houses and public edifices,
constructing roads, and tilling the fields.&nbsp; To them
&ldquo;we are indebted for nearly all the inscriptions discovered
in this country, which abound in the districts where they were
regularly quartered, or employed on public works, and are
comparatively scarce in other localities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great number of coins have been found at various times
within the walls of Chester, of Vespasian, Trajan, Hadrian, Fl.
Val. Constantius, and other Roman emperors, some in brass and
others in silver.&nbsp; A very fine gold coin of Faustina the
elder, wife of Antonius Pius, was found a few years ago, near the
Castle; and in 1826 a very beautiful gold coin was dug up in a
field at the east end of Captain Wrench&rsquo;s house, which is
in the possession of Captain Wrench.&nbsp; On the obverse is the
head of Nero, with his title, <span class="GutSmall">NERO CESAR
AVGVSTVS</span>, and on the reverse is a figure in a sitting
posture, and the legend <span class="GutSmall">SALVS</span>.</p>
<p>Whilst excavating a drain in Grosvenor-street, in 1828,
several coins were found, some of which were in very good
preservation, especially one of Trajan and another of Geta.&nbsp;
A lamp made of lead, and an ivory stylus, were also dug up at the
same time.&nbsp; In the same year was found, near the new church
of St. Bridget, a small altar, without any inscription to assist
the antiquarian in ascertaining anything respecting its
dedication.&nbsp; Within the space of a few inches from the altar
was found a brass medal, on which the figure of the god Neptune
is clearly delineated, with his trident, and a ship with her
sails.&nbsp; The legend on it is <span
class="GutSmall">NEPTVNVS</span>; on the reverse is Hercules with
his club, and a female figure by his side, and around is the
inscription <span class="GutSmall">HERCVLES ET PALLAS</span>.</p>
<p>A short time ago a small votive altar was found by W. Ayrton,
Esq., at Boughton, near to the spot where the altar, previously
described as dedicated to the Nymphs, was discovered.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>The
inscription has been interpreted thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">GENO. AVERNI. IVL.
QVINTILIANVS.<br />
Julius Quintilianus to the Genius of Avernus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Examples of dedication to genii are very numerous; the belief
that they presided over the welfare of cities, families, and
individuals, was part of the religious system of the
Romans.&nbsp; It was generally believed that every individual had
two genii, the one good, the other bad.&nbsp; With reference to
the particular inscription to the genius Avernus, Mr. Roach Smith
says, &ldquo;that he finds no other mention: but the locality in
which the altar was found confirms the literal interpretation
that the genius of the well known lake in Carpania is here to be
understood as addressed by Julius Quintilianus.&nbsp; The waters
of the lake were much used by the Romans in magical rites, as the
classical reader will be reminded by the line in Virgil&rsquo;s
description of the incantation scene, preparatory to Dido&rsquo;s
death:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;&lsquo;Sparserat
et latices simulatos fontis Averni.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A short time ago there was found in Common Hall-street,
imbedded in a thick wall several feet under ground, a singular
block or pig of lead.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the inscription has only been partially
preserved, inasmuch as it presents a different reading from
others which have been discovered, and which Camden mentions as
being very general in Cheshire; but those which he records as
having come under his notice had inscribed on them:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">IMP . DOMIT . AVG . GER
. DE . CEANG.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These pigs of lead appear to have been paid as tribute by the
Britons to their Roman masters, &ldquo;the harsh exaction of
which was one of the causes of the insurrection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great quantity of the Red Samian, and other kinds of
pottery, have been discovered within the walls of Chester, which
are supposed to have been of foreign origin.&nbsp; The names of
the potters were:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>HIVNV.&mdash;SEV. . .
.&mdash;BELINOIM.&mdash;ALBINVS.&mdash;BITVRIX.&mdash;ATILLVS.&mdash;VABIVS
. F.&mdash;I | OFFIC.&mdash;CRESI . M.&mdash;PVONI . M.&mdash;E S

<p>The following recent discoveries we extract from the First
Report of the Chester Architectural, Arch&aelig;ological, and
Historic Society, incorporated in a most able and interesting
paper by C. Roach Smith, Esq.</p>
<p><i>Weaver-street</i>.&mdash;In excavating for sewers was
found, at the depth <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>of seven feet, a raised foot-path, edged with
curb-stones, and a regular paved road, of marble stones set in
sand; four feet above this, a layer of charcoal; at ten or eleven
feet deep, a quantity of Roman tile.</p>
<p><i>Common Hall-street</i>.&mdash;Up the centre, a row of
foundations formed of concrete (broken marble stones in hard
mortar), about nine feet apart, all in a line, and about ten feet
deep, presenting the appearance of having supported
columns.&nbsp; A large square block of stone, four feet two
inches square, and sixteen inches deep, without lewis holes, on a
bed of concrete.&nbsp; A portion of a column of very debased
classical form, about two feet in diameter; at the top is a hole,
four inches and a half square, and the same deep, and a similar
hole at the bottom; the square part seems never to have been
smoothly dressed; the workmen said it was fast to the grouted
concrete, at the depth of ten feet; mouldings, broken tiles, and
pottery, coins of Pius, Tetricus, &amp;c.; a quantity of
animals&rsquo; bones, a stag&rsquo;s skull, with the horns sawn
off, and a wild boar&rsquo;s tusk.&nbsp; In the adjoining street,
a moulded block of cornice, eight inches thick, on the under side
of which is a rude inscription; imbedded in a thick wall, at the
same place, a pig of lead; a capital of a pillar.&nbsp; The tiles
are of various forms, some overlapping one another, some with a
kind of pattern or letters, others with marks of animals&rsquo;
feet.&nbsp; One perfect, twenty-one inches by thirteen, of
singular form.&nbsp; Also, what appears to have been a portion of
a gable end.</p>
<p>In December, 1850, whilst fresh drains were being made, an old
Roman vase was found in a yard belonging to Mr. Parkinson,
plumber, in Northgate-street, between the Abbey-square and the
Abbey Green.&nbsp; The labourer who was employed in the drain in
that neighbourhood unhappily shattered this vase in pieces.&nbsp;
The fragments, however, were collected together with great care,
and re-united by Mr. Parkinson, in whose possession it now
remains.&nbsp; There were found with it some portions of annular
brass money, much corroded.</p>
<p>Near to the Feathers Hotel, in Bridge-street, in a cellar now
occupied as an earthenware shop, are the remains of the Roman
hypocaust and sweating bath, the use of which appears to have
been very general amongst the Romans, and regarded by them as one
of their chief luxuries.&nbsp; From the details which have been
handed down to us by ancient historians, respecting these curious
erections, we learn that they were not only constructed so as to
secure the comfort and convenience of the bathers to the fullest
<a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>extent,
but were often built in the most magnificent style of
architecture.&nbsp; The one in Bridge-street, which circumstances
have happily spared, is in a tolerably perfect state.&nbsp; It is
fifteen feet long, and eight wide, and six feet seven inches
deep.&nbsp; There is an adjoining chamber, or
<i>pr&aelig;furnium</i>, of the same dimensions.&nbsp; The
Hypocaust is supported by twenty-eight square pillars, two feet
eight inches high, and one foot square at the top and
bottom.&nbsp; Over these pillars are placed bricks, eighteen
inches square, and three inches thick, which support others two
feet square, perforated with small holes, about six inches
asunder, for the purpose of conveying the heat upwards.&nbsp;
Immediately above this uppermost layer of bricks is a terrace
floor, composed of several layers of lime, pounded bricks,
&amp;c., in different proportions and degrees of fineness.&nbsp;
The room above is the Sudatorium, or Sweating Room, which
received the hot air from the Hypocaust below.&nbsp; Around the
walls were benches, rising one above another, on which the
bathers sat, until they burst out into a free perspiration; after
which they were scraped with a bronze instrument called a
<i>Strigil</i>&mdash;thin and flexible, like a hoop&mdash;by
which all impurities were removed from the skin; they were then
<i>shampooed</i>, rubbed down with towels (<i>Lintea</i>), and
their bodies anointed with oil, by an attendant called
<i>Aliptes</i>, after which they returned to the
<i>Tepidarium</i>, where they attired themselves, and cooled
gradually before returning to the open air.</p>
<p>In 1779, another Hypocaust, and the remains of several
adjoining rooms of a Roman house, were discovered in digging the
foundations of houses near the Watergate.&nbsp; The pillars of
this Hypocaust, the altar dedicated to <i>Fortuna Redux</i>,
<i>Esculapius et Salus</i>, and a few other antiquities, were
found at the same time, and were removed to Oulton Park.</p>
<p>But small portions of the original Roman wall of Chester now
exist, although undoubted vestiges of that ancient work are
easily discernible.&nbsp; The present wall, no doubt, stands on
the original foundation.&nbsp; The Roman pavement has been often
discovered at the depth of a few feet below the modern road, in
the principal streets, which, in all probability, run in the same
direction as those of the Roman City.&nbsp; During the last few
years, many remarkable antiquities have been discovered in making
excavations for new buildings; and among such remains, a fine
Roman altar, bearing a Greek inscription, has excited great
interest and speculation.</p>

25</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
A WALK ROUND THE WALLS OF CHESTER.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Chester walls are the only
perfect specimen of this order of ancient fortification now to be
met with in England.&nbsp; There is nothing, perhaps, which
impresses a stranger more forcibly, or sooner attracts his
interest and curiosity, than these embattled memorials of the
olden time.</p>
<p>In King&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vale Royal&rsquo; it is stated that
they were first built by Marius, King of the Britons, <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 73.&nbsp; Leland and Selden, both
authors of credit, attribute to the Romans the foundation of
Chester.&nbsp; According to Geoffry of Monmouth, Higden, Bradshaw
the Monk, and Stowe, it is of an origin more ancient than Rome
itself, and was only re-edified by the legionaries; but, in
support of their assertions, the aforesaid writers, all of whom
delight in the marvellous, give no other authority save vague
tradition.&nbsp; On the other hand, the Walls of Chester, at this
hour, bear witness to the truth of Leland and Selden&rsquo;s
account of their origin.</p>
<p>They are built of soft freestone, and command extensive and
beautiful prospects.&nbsp; The view from the Northgate, with the
Welsh Hills in the distance, is universally admired.&nbsp; The
Walls are a mile and three-quarters and one hundred and
twenty-one yards in circumference, and are kept in repair by the
Corporation.</p>
<p>We commence our perambulation at a flight of steps on the
North side of the Eastgate.&nbsp; Proceeding to the right a short
distance, the venerable Cathedral arrests our attention.</p>
<p>At the end of Abbey-street is a small archway or passage
through the Walls, leading to the Kale-yards, or cabbage gardens,
which formerly belonged to the Abbot and Convent of St.
Werburgh.&nbsp; This opening was permitted to be made for their
convenience, in the reign of Edward I., to prevent the necessity
of bringing their vegetables by a circuitous road through the
Eastgate.</p>
<p>A few paces farther on was a quadrangular abutment, on which
formerly stood a tower called <i>The Sadlers&rsquo; Tower</i>,
from the Company of Sadlers holding their meetings there.&nbsp;
The tower was <a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>taken down in 1780; and the abutment, which marked the
place where it stood, was taken down, in 1828.</p>
<p>The elevated tower on the Canal bank belongs to the extensive
Shot and White Lead Manufactory of Messrs. Walker, Parker, and
Co., and forms a prominent object in the different approaches to
the City.</p>
<p>The lofty tower which stands at the angle is called</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Ph&oelig;nix Tower</span>,</h3>
<p>which was formerly used by some of the companies of the city,
whose arms were placed upon it, as a chamber for business.&nbsp;
Of these the <i>Ph&oelig;nix</i>, the crest of the
Painters&rsquo; and Stationers&rsquo; Company, which was put up
in 1613, now only remains.</p>
<p>From the summit of this tower, King Charles I. had the
mortification to see his army, under the generalship of Sir
Marmaduke Langdale, defeated by the Parliamentary forces, which
were led by General Pointz, at the battle of Rowton Moor, on the
27th September, 1645.&nbsp; From its elevation and command of
view over the township of Newton, it was formerly called
<i>Newton&rsquo;s Tower</i>.&nbsp; Linked as it is with that
eventful battle during one of the most significant epochs of our
national history, it is not surprising that it is always regarded
with intense curiosity, as a suggestive memorial of most
interesting occurrences.&nbsp; The mind is involuntarily carried
back to the period when our country was involved in the discord,
strife, and bloodshed of civil war; and, perhaps, as
involuntarily reflects on the genial and happy change which the
progress of knowledge, freedom, and religion has accomplished in
the minds and institutions of the people.&nbsp; We can now occupy
the very spot on which the hapless monarch beheld the
discomfiture of his hopes and power; but can gaze upon a prospect
very different from that which greeted his vision, and with
emotions more grateful than those which then distracted the
monarch&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; His Majesty remained that night in
Chester, and on the following day marched with 500 horse into
Wales.</p>
<p>Beneath the walls here, deeply cut in the solid rock, is the
Ellesmere and Chester Canal.</p>
<p>Between the Eastgate and Ph&oelig;nix Tower the remains of the
Roman Walls are conspicuous in the lower courses.&nbsp; At the
distance of about seven feet from the top of the parapet, the
Roman portion is terminated by a cornice, which extends in broken
lengths for at least 100 yards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>In the
time of the great Rebellion, a ditch surrounded the Walls, from
the Eastgate to the Water Tower.&nbsp; The view which is obtained
from the elevation of this part of the Walls is very extensive
and beautiful.&nbsp; As you approach the North from the Eastgate,
the ranges of Peckforton Hills, Beeston Castle, and the Forest of
Delamere, form the background of the landscape, marked on the
foreground with Waverton and Christleton churches; and, still
nearer, the commodious Railway Station.</p>
<p>Next we arrive at</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Northgate</span>.</h3>
<p>The ancient gate, over which the gaol was situated, and where
criminals were formerly executed, was taken down in 1808, and the
prisoners removed to a more commodious building on the south side
of the infirmary.</p>
<p>The present gate is a Doric structure, forming a capacious
elliptic arch of white stone, divided from two smaller ones at
the sides by two pillars.&nbsp; It was erected at the expense of
the late Marquis of Westminster.&nbsp; The North side bears this
inscription&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">PORTAM SEPTENTRIONALEM
SVBSTRVCTAM<br />
A ROMANIS VETVSTATE JAM DILAPSAM<br />
IMPENSIS SVIS AB INTEGRO RESTITVENDAM<br />
CVRAVIT ROBERTVS COMES GROSVENOR.<br />
A. R. GEORGII TERTII LI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the South side is the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">INCHOTA GVLIELMO NEWELL
ARM. MAI.<br />
MDCCCVIII.<br />
PERFECTA THOMA GROSVENOR ARM. MAI.<br />
MDCCCX.<br />
THOMA HARRISON ABCHITECTO.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The summit of this gate commands a most extensive and
delightful prospect.&nbsp; On each side of the gate is a
commodious flight of steps, by which the passenger may descend
into Northgate-street.</p>
<p>Near the gate, and on the left hand of Upper Northgate-street,
stands the Blue-coat Hospital, which was founded by subscription
in 1700, at the suggestion of Bishop Stratford.&nbsp; The greater
part of the present structure was built in 1717, partly at the
expense of the Corporation and partly by benefactions.&nbsp;
Thirty-two boys are boarded, clothed, and educated, from the age
of twelve to fourteen.&nbsp; There are also sixty probationary
day scholars, who succeed to the vacancies of the former.&nbsp;
They are well educated in the various branches of useful
knowledge, and at the age of fourteen are provided with
respectable situations.</p>
<p><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>The
chapel, dedicated to St. John the Baptist, called Little St.
John&rsquo;s, occupies the south wing of this building; it was
formerly an hospital, or sanctuary, and endowed with great
privileges.&nbsp; It is extra-parochial, and a perpetual curacy
is in the gift of the Corporation.&nbsp; The Rev. William Clarke
is the present curate.&nbsp; The hospital is of great antiquity,
having been founded by Randal, Earl of Chester, for a master,
three chaplains, and thirteen citizens of Chester, being either
&ldquo;poor or sillie, or poor or feeble persons.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The mastership was granted in the ninth year of Edward Second to
the prior of Birkenhead.</p>
<p>The chapel and hospital being destroyed during the civil wars,
were rebuilt by Colonel Roger Whitley, to whom King Charles
Second granted the hospital estate for his life and twenty years
after.&nbsp; When the city charter was renewed in 1686, the
reversions were granted to the mayor and citizens for ever, as
trustees for the hospital.&nbsp; The Corporation obtained
possession in 1703, and have since exercised the right of
presentation.&nbsp; In the time of King Henry VIII. it consisted
of a chaplain and six poor brethren; and had lands and profits to
the amount of &pound;28 10s. 4d.&nbsp; In later days there were
in the Chapel-yard six almshouses for widows, who were each
allowed &pound;1 6s. 8d. a year and some perquisites.&nbsp; In
1801, Alderman Crewe bequeathed &pound;30 per annum to be divided
amongst them in equal proportions.&nbsp; Under an amended scheme,
by order of the Court of Chancery, in 1852, the almshouses were
rebuilt, and provision is now made for thirteen &ldquo;poor and
impotent persons of both sexes,&rdquo; to each of whom the sum of
&pound;26 a year, by weekly payments of 10s., is given.&nbsp;
They have free occupation of the houses, and &pound;30 per
annum.&nbsp; Alderman Crewe&rsquo;s legacy is expended for their
benefit in coals and other articles of domestic comfort.</p>
<p>Proceeding on our circuit, we next reach a curious square
building called <span class="smcap">Morgan&rsquo;s Mount</span>,
a platform on the right, accessible by a flight of steps,
underneath which is a sort of chamber, apparently one of the
stations for a sentinel.&nbsp; From the summit we have a
wide-spreading and enchanting prospect, exhibiting the windings
of the Dee to its estuary; Flint Castle; the Jubilee Column, on
Moel Fammau; the Lighthouse, at the point of Ayr; the beautiful
range of the Clwyddian hills; and the church and castle of
Hawarden.&nbsp; On the right, a very excellent view is presented
of the</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Training College</span>,</h3>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>which
was erected from a design and under the superintendence of
Messrs. J. C. and G. Buckler, of London, at an estimated cost of
&pound;10,000, raised by public subscription, assisted by a grant
from Government, and was completed in September, 1842.&nbsp; The
institution is under the presidency of the Lord Bishop of the
diocese, and has the sanction of the Deans and Chapters of
Chester and Manchester.&nbsp; The object it seeks to promote is,
the supply of the parochial schools of the Diocese of Chester
with masters well qualified by a sound religious and scientific
training, for the discharge of their important duties.&nbsp;
Hitherto, it has nobly sustained its purpose, and, by regularly
sending forth men whose minds have been brought under thorough
discipline, and well furnished with general knowledge and
science, is doing very much towards the elevation of parochial
education in the diocese.&nbsp; The college is under the able
direction of the Rev. Arthur Rigg, M.A., of Christ&rsquo;s
College, Cambridge.&nbsp; A handsome chapel is attached to the
college.</p>
<p>In the Minutes of the Committee of Council on Education for
1850, there are the following remarks, by the Rev. Henry Moseley,
upon the Chester Training College:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have to bear the same testimony as
heretofore to the excellent discipline of the Institution; to the
great order that pervades it; and to the judicious arrangements
made in respect to the industrial training of the students, the
industry, cheerfulness, and activity with which these labours are
pursued, in the intervals of study, is most pleasing to
contemplate.&nbsp; I know no other training school which, in
respect to these things, appears to me superior to this; and I
attach to them, in a moral point of view, the first
importance.&nbsp; Nor do I know any other in which the buildings
appear to me better adapted to the use of a training school, or
in which those minor arrangements, on which the domestic comfort
of the inmates and the good order of the household depend, are
more carefully observed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few paces further on is an ancient tower, formerly called
the <i>Goblin&rsquo;s Tower</i>, but now known by the name of
<span class="smcap">Pemberton&rsquo;s Parlour</span>.&nbsp; Being
in a ruinous condition, part of it was taken down in 1702, and
the remainder renovated and repaired.&nbsp; On the front was some
excellent carved work in stone, and the names of the then Mayor
(the Earl of Derby) and the other corporate officers of the year
in which the repairs were made; but in consequence of the stone
being of a soft and friable nature, and from other causes, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>both the
inscription and the carved work are now almost obliterated.&nbsp;
The inscription, so far as it is legible, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo; * * * year of the glorious reign of Queen
Anne divers wide breaches in these walls were rebuilt, and other
decays therein were repaired; 2,000 yards of the pavement were
new flagged or paved, and the whole repaired, regulated, and
adorned, at the expense of &pound;1,000 and upwards.&nbsp; Thomas
Hand, Esq., Mayor, 1701.&nbsp; The Right Honourable William, Earl
of Derby, Mayor, 1702, who died in his Mayoralty.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the left is a large field, anciently called <i>Barrow
Field</i>, which was used by the Roman soldiers for their
military exercises; a vast number of bodies were buried here at
one of the periods when the plague raged so severely in the
city.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Continuing our route westward, we next come to</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Water Tower</span>,</h3>
<p>an ancient fortress, erected for the purpose of repelling the
approach of maritime foes, for it appears that formerly the river
flowed under this part of the walls, so that vessels could sail
close by the Tower.&nbsp; At high tide, the whole of the land on
which are now situated Crane-street and the neighbourhood, was
covered with water.&nbsp; At the south angle of the walls is an
old square tower, anciently called <i>Bonwaldesthorne&rsquo;s
Tower</i>, from which is an embattled passage to the Water Tower,
which was built in 1322, by contract for &pound;100, by John
Helpstone, a mason.&nbsp; The dimensions were 24 yards in height,
and 10&frac12; yards in diameter.&nbsp; It had openings for
cannon and rings in the walls, to which ships were formerly
moored.&nbsp; This noble bulwark is suggestive of reflections of
deep historic interest; for at the siege of Chester by the
Republican army, this place was bombarded from the farm-house
called Brewer&rsquo;s Hall, on the opposite side of the river,
but without success.&nbsp; Many a gallant sentinel has here kept
loyal watch against the approach of the enemy.&nbsp; Happily, our
age needs not these ancient fortifications for the warlike
purpose to which they were originally devoted, and as an
exhibition of the genius of the thirteenth and nineteenth
centuries in happy contrast, this tower, built for war, is now
occupied as a</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Museum of the Mechanics&rsquo;
Institution</span>,</h3>
<p>and is devoted to the more beneficent object of science and
general improvement.&nbsp; Although the Museum is but of recent
origin, the zeal and liberality of its supporters have already
well furnished it with valuable relies, which will interest the
antiquary, and other <a name="page31"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 31</span>curiosities of more modern date,
which afford gratification to all.&nbsp; The munificent
liberality of William Wardell, Esq., a devoted friend to every
enterprise which contemplates the social and intellectual
advancement of the citizens, enables us to point out an
attractive object in the</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Camera Obscura</span>,</h3>
<p>which is situated on the upper part of the tower.&nbsp; We can
promise the reader much amusement from this excellent instrument,
which will furnish him with a most charming prospect of the
diversified and lovely scenery of the district.&nbsp; On the top
of the tower is fixed a very good telescope by Dollond, which
commands a most extensive and magnificent view.&nbsp; If the day
be favourable, and the atmosphere clear, we can stretch our gaze
over a wide and truly grand range of objects, embracing the Great
Ormshead at Llandudno in Carnarvonshire, the Wrekin in
Shropshire, Moel Fammau and the Welsh Hills, towering aloft in
their tranquil majesty.&nbsp; Across the river is Brewer&rsquo;s
Hall, which we have mentioned, where Cromwell&rsquo;s army
erected a battery, for the purpose of destroying this tower,
&ldquo;but which had no great effect;&rdquo; close by is the
Railway Viaduct of forty-seven arches, and the Bridge crossing
the Dee on cast-iron girders; the whole scene forming an
exceedingly fine panorama.</p>
<p>At the foot of the flight of steps close by are the City Baths
and Wash-houses.&nbsp; The swimming bath is very capacious, and
the necessary adjuncts most complete: there are also private and
shower baths.</p>
<p>We now resume our walk; and, proceeding southwards from the
Water Tower, on the left, is</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Infirmary</span>;</h3>
<p>a handsome brick building, founded by Dr. William Stratford,
who bequeathed &pound;300 to the charity.&nbsp; It was opened on
the 17th March, 1761.&nbsp; It is capable of containing 100 beds,
with commodious offices, and excellent accommodation for its
respective officers.&nbsp; The north part of the building is
exclusively devoted to a fever ward.&nbsp; This asylum for the
afflicted is liberally supported by voluntary
subscriptions.&nbsp; Donors of twenty guineas, and subscribers of
two guineas per annum, are governors, with the privilege of
recommending two in-patients, and six out-door patients
annually.</p>
<p>The inmates receive the most humane and skilful attention from
<a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the
medical staff, which consists of Honorary Physicians and
Surgeons, a Resident Surgeon, and an Assistant.</p>
<p>The number of patients admitted during the year 1857
were&mdash;</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Of all the charitable institutions which do honour to the
benevolence of the city, the Infirmary ranks the first in
beneficial and important operations, and eminently deserves the
sympathy and support of the public.</p>
<p>The next large building close by is</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The City Gaol</span>,</h3>
<p>which also includes the <span class="smcap">House of
Correction</span>; both are under the superintendence of a
committee of the Town Council.&nbsp; The Gaol is in the western
part of the building, with a good Doric entrance.&nbsp; Over the
front entrance, within the iron railing, the condemned criminals
are executed.&nbsp; The entrance to the House of Correction is at
the east end, and is also of stone.&nbsp; Each of these
establishments has four courts, with cells and day rooms
adjoining; and both are under the government of one gaoler and a
male and female assistant.&nbsp; There is a chapel common to both
establishments.&nbsp; The chaplain is appointed by the
Corporation.&nbsp; In consequence of the escapes the prisoners
have succeeded in making from time to time, many improvements
have been made in the internal arrangements of the prison, since
it was first built, respecting the classification of prisoners
and other matters; and the outworks of the building have received
some important additions to ensure their greater security.&nbsp;
A little further on to the left is Stanley-place, a pleasant,
open square of modern residences, leading to the Linen Hall
Cheese Mart, which is well supplied at the fairs, held six times
during the year, with Cheese from the dairies of Cheshire and
North Wales.</p>
<p>We now ascend a handsome gateway called</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Watergate</span>,</h3>
<p>the custody of which formerly belonged to the Earls of Derby,
who held a valuable river jurisdiction, in executing the
mayor&rsquo;s warrants on the Dee, which formerly flowed close
underneath.&nbsp; It was purchased from the Derby family by the
Corporation in 1778, taken down in 1788, and the present
structure erected in 1789, the expense being defrayed out of the
murage duties fund.&nbsp; It <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>consists of a wide and lofty arch,
thrown over the Watergate-street, where a rapid descent adds much
to its apparent elevation.&nbsp; The west side bears the
following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">IN THE XXIX. YEAR OF THE REIGN OF GEO. III. IN
THE</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">MAYORALTY OF JOHN HALLWOOD, AND JOHN
LEIGH, ESQUIRES,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">THIS GATE WAS ERECTED.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THOMAS
COTGREAVE, EDWARD BURROWS, ESQUIRES, MURENGERS.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The view from the summit of this gate is very extensive, the
objects immediately surrounding adding much to the pleasure of
the scene.&nbsp; On the opposite bank of the river Dee is Curzon
Park, with its beautiful villa residences.&nbsp; On the left is
Grosvenor Bridge, with its far-famed noble arch, the widest arch
of masonry in the world; a little beyond may be seen the grand
lodge entrance to Eaton Park, erected at the cost of
&pound;14,000, the <i>toute ensemble</i> forming a most charming
picture.&nbsp; The site of the present Crane-street and the parts
adjacent were formerly under water.</p>
<p>Immediately below is the beautiful and spacious meadow called
the</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Roodeye</span>.</h3>
<p>It contains about eighty-four statute acres of land, and is
let by the Corporation as a pasture for cattle.&nbsp; It was once
the arena for ancient sports, and the city games and gymnastics
were celebrated here, respecting which there are many curious
records extant.&nbsp; Of these, however, the horse races alone
remain, which continue to be held in the first week of May, this
Spring meeting being considered one of the most important and
interesting illustrations of the national sports of the
turf.&nbsp; The course is little more than a mile, and affords
the spectators the singular advantage of seeing the horses during
the whole race.&nbsp; The Earl of Chester&rsquo;s Regiment of
Yeomanry Cavalry assembles annually on the Roodeye for
exercise.</p>
<p>The antiquity of the Chester races appears from the following
extract from the collection of the late Mr. Nicholls of Chorlton,
to whose researches the authors of the &lsquo;History of
Cheshire&rsquo; are much indebted.&nbsp; The MS. from which this
is extracted is entitled,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Certayne collections of anciante

GEORGE&rsquo;S RACE, OF LATE TIME INVENTED, AND WHEN

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1609,
Mr. William Lester, mercer, beinge mayor of Chester, one Mr.
Robert Amerye, ironmonger, sometime sheriffe of Chester (<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1608), he, with the assent of the
mayor and cittie, at his own coste chiefly, as I conceive
chiefly, caused three silver cupps, of goode value, to be made,
the which saide silver cupps were, upon St. George&rsquo;s daye,
for ever to be thus disposed: all gentlemen that would bringe
their horses to the Rood-dee that daye, and there run, that horse
which with speede did over-rune the reste, shoulde have the beste
cuppe there presently delivered, and that horse which came
seconde, next the firste, before the reste, had the seconde cuppe
there also delivered; and for the thirde cuppe, it was to be run
for at the ringe, by any gentleman that woulde rune for the same,
upon the said Rood-dee, and upon St. George&rsquo;s daye; being
thus decreed, that every horse putt in soe much monie as made the
value of the cupps or bells, and had the money, which horses did
winne the same, and the use of the cupps, till that day twelve
month, beinge in bonde to deliver in the cupps that daye; soe
also for the cuppe for the ringe, which was yearly continued
accordingly, until the yeare of our Lord 1623; John Brereton,
inn-holder, beinge mayor of Chester, he altered the same after
this manner, and caused the three cupps to be sould, and caused
more money to be gathered and added, soe that the intereste
thereof would make one faire silver cuppe, of the value of
&pound;8 as I suppose, it maye be more worth, and the race to be
altered, viz., from beyonde the New Tower a great distance, and
soe to rune five times from that place rownd about the Rood-dee,
and he that overcame all the reste the last course, to have the
cuppe freely for ever, then and there delivered, which is
continued to this daye.&nbsp; But here I must not omit the
charge, and the solemnitie made the first of St. George&rsquo;s
daye; he had a poet, one Mr. Davies, who made speeches and
poeticale verses, which were delivered at the high crosse, before
the mayor and aldermen, with shews of his invention, which booke
was imprinted and presented to that famous Prince Henry, eldest
sonne to the blessed King James, of famous memorie.&nbsp; Alsoe
he caused a man to go upon the spire of St. Peter&rsquo;s steeple
in Chester, and by the fane, at the same tyme he sounded the
drum, and displayed a banner upon the top of the same
spire.&nbsp; And this was the original of St. George&rsquo;s race
with the change thereof, as it is now used.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>On the
west side of the Roodeye stands</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The House of Industry</span>,</h3>
<p>built by the Corporation in 1757, as a refuge for age and
indigence.&nbsp; Warm and cold baths are established for the use
of the inmates, whose comfort is most studiously consulted and
provided for.&nbsp; The pleasant row of houses on the right of
the Roodeye is called Paradise-row, the site of which, as appears
by an ancient map, was once in the bed of the river.</p>
<p>Soon after passing the Watergate, on the left, there is an
opening to the city, called Smith&rsquo;s-walk, at the bottom of
which stands a large house, on the site of which formerly stood
the Priory of White Friars or Carmelites.</p>
<p>On the north side of the open field on the left is a pleasant
mansion, now the Rectory house of St. Bridget&rsquo;s parish, but
formerly the residence of the late Thomas Harrison, Esq., the
celebrated architect, who has immortalized his genius in some of
the finest works of which Chester can boast.&nbsp; Near this spot
once stood a convent of Benedictine nuns, dedicated to St.
Mary.&nbsp; It was suppressed, with the other lesser monasteries,
in 1537, and no vestige of the ancient building now remains.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further on our circuit round the walls, we
recommend the visitor to turn off to the right on the road, for
the purpose of inspecting the</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">New Cemetery</span>, near the Grosvenor
Bridge.</h3>
<p>It is beautifully laid out, and arranged with admirable taste,
and was rendered necessary by the overcrowded state of the
parochial burial grounds.&nbsp; Opposite the Cemetery gates is a
suspension bridge, for foot passengers, to Curzon Park, whence we
have a fine panoramic view of Chester.</p>
<p>We now retrace our steps to survey that interesting
structure,</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Castle</span>.</h3>
<p>We have no precise authority whereby to ascertain the date of
the foundation of Chester Castle.&nbsp; Some think there is good
reason to believe it to be of Roman origin, and of equal
antiquity with the City Walls.&nbsp; Others have fixed the date
of its erection <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1069, by
William the Conqueror; but there are some considerations which
seem to point to an earlier period than this.&nbsp; It is stated
by Camden to have been <i>repaired</i> by Hugh Lupus, and
additional fortifications erected by the Norman Earls his
successors.&nbsp; It was <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>certainly the palace of the local
monarchs, as well as their chief stronghold, and retained much of
this mixed character until modern alterations were made.&nbsp;
Pennant describes the Castle, as it formerly stood, as being
composed of two parts, an upper and a lower, each with a strong
gate, defended by a round bastion on each side, with a ditch and
draw-bridges.</p>
<p>In 1237, upon the death of John Scott, the last earl of the
Norman line, the Commissioners of Henry III. seized Chester
Castle for the King.</p>
<p>In 1265 James De Aldithley and Urian De St. Pierre, at the
head of the citizens of Chester, besieged Luke De Taney,
King&rsquo;s Justice, in the Castle, which held out for ten
weeks, when, upon receiving intelligence of the battle of
Evesham, he surrendered.</p>
<p>Henry of Lancaster (afterwards Henry IV.), having taken up
arms against Richard II. in 1399, mustered his army upon the bank
of the Dee, under the walls of Chester, and Sir Piers Legh of
Lyme, an adherent of Richard, was beheaded, and his head set upon
the top of the highest tower in the Castle.&nbsp; Shortly
afterwards, the unfortunate Richard and the Earl of Salisbury
were brought prisoners to Chester, mounted (says Hall)
&ldquo;upon two little nagges, not worth forty franks,&rdquo;
when the King was delivered &ldquo;to the Duke of
Gloucester&rsquo;s sonne and the Earl of Arundell&rsquo;s sonne,
that loved him but a little, for he had put their fathers to
death, who led him strait to the castell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1403 Henry Percy, surnamed Hotspur, visited Chester on his
way to the fatal field of Shrewsbury, and caused proclamation to
be made, that King Richard was yet alive, and a prisoner in
Chester Castle, where he might be seen.</p>
<p>Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, wife of the <i>Good Duke
Humphrey</i>, was confined for several months in Chester Castle,
in 1447, previous to her removal to the Isle of Man, under a
sentence of perpetual imprisonment, on a charge of
&ldquo;practising the King&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, in 1651, the Puritans, in their peculiar phraseology,
&ldquo;<i>sought the Lord</i>,&rdquo; by trying and condemning to
death the gallant and patriotic Earl of Derby, Sir Timothy
Featherstonehaugh, and Captain Benbow.&nbsp; According to
Whitlocke, the Earl &ldquo;attempted to escape, and was let down
by a rope from the leads of his chamber; but some hearing a
noise, made after him, and he was retaken upon Dee
bank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ancient structure was taken down at the close of the last
century, and the present edifice erected on its site.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>The
principal entrance is through a handsome portico of Grecian Doric
architecture.&nbsp; It is 103 feet by 35, and consists of a
centre and two wings connected by covered passages.&nbsp; The ten
fluted columns, which compose the peristyle in the centre, are
each cut out of a single block of stone.&nbsp; It is situated in
the centre of a semicircular sunk fence or foss, 13 feet deep,
and 390 feet in diameter, cased with hewn stone, surmounted with
stone pedestals at equal distances, and the spaces filled with
handsome iron rails, forming the north-west boundary of the
esplanade.</p>
<p>On the western side of the esplanade is the Armoury, capable
of containing between 30,000 and 40,000 stand of arms.&nbsp; This
is well worthy the inspection of strangers, who cannot fail to be
struck with the excellent state in which the military stores are
kept, and the tasteful arrangement of the arms.</p>
<p>Within the gate at the east end of this range of buildings is
the guard-house, behind which is a venerable tower, called
<i>Julius Agricola&rsquo;s</i>, or <i>C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s</i>,
which is still entire, and partly occupied as a magazine.&nbsp;
Within this tower is a curious chapel, mentioned in the tax-book
of Henry VIII. as the chantry &ldquo;<i>infra Castrum
Cestri&aelig;</i>&rdquo; and yielding as its tenth 10s. 8d.&nbsp;
It is an upper chamber, about 19 feet by 16, and 16 feet in
height.&nbsp; The roof, which is vaulted and groined, is of
stone.&nbsp; On one side is a plain pointed recess in the wall,
the back of which appears to have been ornamented with paintings,
and was probably the altar.&nbsp; James II. heard mass in this
chapel.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Gaol and County Hall</span>.</h3>
<p>The principal entrance to the Shire Hall is through a portico
of twelve columns in double rows, 22 feet high, and 3 feet
1&frac12; inches in diameter, each formed of a single
stone.&nbsp; The ceiling, roof, and covering, are also of
stone.&nbsp; The hall is of a semicircular form, measuring 80
feet by 50, including the judgment-seat, and 44 feet high, and is
lighted from above.&nbsp; The ceiling is a semi-dome, boldly
caissoned with ventilators opening to the roof, in the shape of
ornamental roses.&nbsp; It is supported by a row of twelve Ionic
columns, each composed of a single stone, from the bases of which
there is a gradual descent by a flight of circular steps to the
bar, which enables every one in the body of the court to have a
perfect view of the judges, counsel, prisoners, and
witnesses.&nbsp; There is a subterraneous passage from the dock
to the prison, which affords both facility and safety in the
removal of the prisoners.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>On the
right of the entrance to the County Hall are the Grand Jury Room
and the Prothonotary&rsquo;s Offices.&nbsp; In a small room on
the ground floor is the model of the Grosvenor Bridge, and there
are full length portraits of William III., Charles II., George
I., George II., and Frederick, Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>On the left is the entrance to the County Gaol, which may vie
in every respect with any other establishment of the sort in the
kingdom.&nbsp; It is built upon two levels.&nbsp; On the east
side of the range of buildings on the upper level is the
Deputy-Governor&rsquo;s house; adjoining are the day and sleeping
rooms of the male debtors, with a large and commodious yard,
commanding a view of the surrounding country; and in an extensive
wing are the convicts&rsquo; cells, apartments for the female
debtors and prisoners, with the matron&rsquo;s house and
hospital.&nbsp; In the centre, projecting beyond the level, and
of a semicircular form, so as to command a view of the court
yards, &amp;c., are the gaoler&rsquo;s or governor&rsquo;s
apartments.&nbsp; Underneath the governor&rsquo;s apartments, and
of the same form, is the chapel, which has lately been rebuilt
and much improved.&nbsp; It is situate between the upper and
lower level, and so contrived as to receive the debtors and
criminals into different compartments, from their respective
court yards.&nbsp; Divine service is performed in the chapel
every morning during the week, and twice every Sunday.&nbsp; The
Rev. J. M. Kilner is the present chaplain, who is most
indefatigable in the discharge of his duties.&nbsp; On the lower
level, under the jailor&rsquo;s house, are the felons&rsquo;
yards, five in number.&nbsp; They are spacious and airy, and each
contains a pump and trough.&nbsp; A sort of area or passage
surrounds these yards, and beyond that is the outside wall, built
of immense blocks of stone, and conveying at once the idea of
security and solidity.&nbsp; Nothing can exceed the excellent
discipline and general arrangement of the prisoners.&nbsp; A
large proportion of the prisoners are profitably employed, under
the superintendence of a task-master.&nbsp; They are chiefly
engaged in calico, rug, and carpet weaving, shoe-making, and
basket-making.&nbsp; The greater part of the articles of clothing
and bed furniture used within the walls are manufactured by them;
and the store-room presents the appearance of a complete
depository of useful articles for the prison, of almost every
description.</p>
<p>There is also a commodious schoolroom, which is efficiently
superintended.&nbsp; Everything relating to the internal
management of this prison is complete in each department, and
reflects the highest credit on the governor, Mr. Dunstan.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>Previous to the new erections, on the east side of the
lower court stood the ancient Shire Hall, in which the courts of
justice for the county used to be held.&nbsp; It was a
magnificent building, nearly 90 feet in length, and 45 in
breadth; the height very lofty, and worthy the state apartment of
the first Norman Earl, Hugh Lupus, who required a hall suitable
to the greatness of his hospitality.&nbsp; Adjoining to this hall
was the Court of Exchequer, or Court of Chancery, of the county
palatine of Chester.&nbsp; It was the Parliament House of the
little kings of the palatinate, and had neat gothic seats for the
abbot and eight barons.</p>
<p>The east side of the esplanade is appropriated to Barracks,
which contain excellent and spacious accommodations.&nbsp; Behind
the Barracks is the Provost, with an enclosed yard.&nbsp; It is
no longer employed for this purpose, having been, some time
since, converted into an armoury for pensioners, military library
and reading-room, &amp;c.&nbsp; This wing, and the opposite one
on the west side of the esplanade, were built at the joint
expense of the Crown and the County Palatine.</p>
<p>Proceeding through the gate at the east end, we come to</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Sessions House</span>,</h3>
<p>a neat and commodious edifice, with a tolerably spacious
court, magistrates&rsquo; and grand jury rooms, and a robing room
for counsel on the ground floor; and upstairs are the Clerk of
the Peace&rsquo;s record rooms and other offices.</p>
<p>Before leaving the Castle yard, the attention of the visitor
will naturally be attracted by memorials of the Crimean war, in
the form of two Russian guns, mounted on either side of the grand
entrance, under a portico, enclosed with iron railings.&nbsp; On
each of these formidable pieces of ordnance is inscribed the
following historical memorandum:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">THIS GUN</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">WAS CAPTURED BY THE ALLIED ARMIES

</blockquote>
<p>Having completed our view of the Castle, we return to continue
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>our walk,
proceeding along the walls until we reach the boundary of the
Castle, where the tourist will have a fine view of the</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Grosvenor Bridge</span>.</h3>
<p>This noble work of art, which is unequalled in the history of
bridge-building, crosses the Dee at the south-east angle of the
Roodeye, and is approached by a new road from the centre of
Bridge-street, which passes by the Castle esplanade, proceeds
across the City Walls, and then, by an immense embankment, thrown
over a deep valley, to the foot of the bridge.&nbsp; The bridge
consists of one main stone arch, with a small dry arch or towing
path on each side, by which the land communication is preserved
on both sides of the river.&nbsp; The cost of erection was
&pound;36,000.</p>
<p>The great distinguishing feature of this edifice is the
unparalleled width of the chord or span of the main arch, which
is of greater extent than that of any other known to have been
constructed.&nbsp; Of its dimensions the following is an accurate
delineation:&mdash;The span of the arch, <i>two hundred feet</i>.
<a name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a>&nbsp; Height of the arch from the
springing line, 40 feet.&nbsp; Dimensions of the main abutments,
48 feet wide by 40, with a dry arch as a towing path at each
side, 20 feet wide, flanked with immense wing walls, to support
the embankment.&nbsp; The whole length of the roadway, 340
feet.&nbsp; Width of the bridge from outside the parapet walls,
35 feet 6 inches, divided thus: carriage road, 24 feet; the two
causeways, 9 feet; thickness of the parapet walls, 2 feet 6
inches.&nbsp; Altitude from the top of the parapet wall to the
river at low-water mark, 66 feet 6 inches.&nbsp; The
architectural plan of this bridge was furnished by the late
Thomas Harrison, Esq.; contractor and builder, Mr. James
Trubshaw, of Staffordshire; surveyor, Mr. Jesse Hartley, of
Liverpool.&nbsp; The first stone was laid on the 1st October,
1827, by the late Marquis of Westminster, and a specimen of each
of the current coins of the realm deposited therein; and was
formally opened in October, 1832, by her Royal Highness the
Princess Victoria (her present Most Gracious Majesty), on
occasion of her visit, and that of her Royal mother, the Duchess
of Kent, to Eaton Hall.&nbsp; As a compliment to her noble host,
at the request of the commissioners, the bridge was named
&ldquo;Grosvenor Bridge,&rdquo; by the young Princess.&nbsp; It
was opened to the public in December, 1833.</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>It was
opposite to this part of the Walls that King Edgar&rsquo;s palace
was situated, from which he was rowed up the river to St.
John&rsquo;s Priory, by eight tributary princes, in 971.</p>
<p>Within seventy yards of the bridge formerly stood an ancient
Roman gateway in the walls, called the <span
class="smcap">Shipgate</span>, or <i>Hole in the Wall</i>, at one
time the only entrance into Chester from Handbridge.&nbsp; It was
taken down some years ago, and is now in the possession of Thomas
Finchett Maddock, Esq.&nbsp; It forms a perfect specimen of Roman
masonry, originally 20 feet in height by 16 in breadth.&nbsp;
Pennant remarks, &ldquo;that this postern seems originally to
have been designed for the common passage over the Dee into the
country of the Ordovices, either by means of a boat at high
water, or by a ford at low, the river here being remarkably
shallow.&rdquo;&nbsp; Opposite the Shipgate is a ford in the
river leading through to a field on the Handbridge side, called
<i>Edgar&rsquo;s Field</i>, in which stands the ancient sculpture
of the <i>Diva Armigera</i> <span class="smcap">Pallas</span>,
already mentioned under the head of &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Roman Antiquities</span>,&rdquo; in a former part
of this work.</p>
<p>Pursuing our walk, we next arrive at</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Bridgegate</span>,</h3>
<p>a handsome arch gateway, having two posterns, erected in 1782,
at the expense of the Corporation.&nbsp; On the tablet over the
western postern is the following inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">THIS GATE WAS BEGUN APRIL, MDCCLXXXII.,
PATISON</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">ELLAMES, ESQ., MAYOR, AND FINISHED

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THOS.
COTGREAVE, ESQ., HENRY HESKETH, ESQ., MURENGERS.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">JOSEPH

</blockquote>
<p>On another tablet, on the east side,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">THIS GATE, HAVING BEEN LONG
INCONVENIENT,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">WAS TAKEN DOWN A.D. MDCCLXXXI.</span></p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">JOSEPH SNOW, ESQ., MAYOR.</span></p>
<p><span class="GutSmall">THOS. AMERY, HENRY HEGG,
TREASURERS.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the top of this gateway the banks of the Dee, with the
bridge, and suburbs of Handbridge, present a lively and striking
appearance, which at low water is increased by the rapid falling
of the stream over the causeway across the river immediately
above the bridge.&nbsp; In the distance may be seen Beeston
Castle, on its <a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>lofty summit; and the successive ranges of Bucklow and
Peckforton Hills form a beautiful background to the
landscape.</p>
<p>A little southward stands</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Old Bridge</span>,</h3>
<p>which is of considerable antiquity.&nbsp; A wooden bridge was
erected on the same spot by the Mercian Princess Ethelfleda,
early in the tenth century; but from the &lsquo;Chronicle of
Chester Abbey,&rsquo; we learn that in 1227 &ldquo;pons
Cestri&aelig; totus cecidit;&rdquo; and that in 1279 &ldquo;mare
erupit, pontem Cestri&aelig; confregit et
asportavit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The wooden bridge being thus disposed
of, we next find from the &lsquo;Red Book of St. Werburgh,&rsquo;
that &ldquo;in 1280 the King (Edward I.) compelled the citizens
of Chester to rebuild Dee Bridge at their own charge, contrary to
the privileges which had been granted to them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
1500, the south end of the Bridge, having fallen into decay, was
rebuilt, and a tower for its defence added at the entrance into
Handbridge, which was taken down about sixty years ago.&nbsp; In
1826 the Bridge was widened to the extent of seven feet, by the
addition of a flagged footpath, on the east side, bounded towards
the river by a good iron railing, the projection supported by two
courses of corbels.</p>
<p>It consists of seven irregular arches, and when viewed from
the west, presents an appearance of venerable antiquity; but on
the east it no longer holds out that recommendation to the eye of
the observer, modern alterations having left nothing on that side
to render it worthy of notice.</p>
<p>At the north end of the Bridge stand the</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Dee Mills</span>,</h3>
<p>used for the grinding of corn.&nbsp; Although the date of the
first erection of mills on this spot cannot now be ascertained,
yet there is evidence of their having been there from remote
antiquity.&nbsp; Sir Howell-y-Fwyall obtained a grant of them
from Edward III. in reward for his services at the battle of
Poictiers.&nbsp; In the fifth of Edward VI. they were granted by
the Crown to Sir Richard Cotton, in exchange for the manors of
Bourne and Moreton, in Lincolnshire; and by his son George they
were granted in fee farm to Edmund Gamul, at a yearly rent of
&pound;100.&nbsp; Gamul expended a large sum in repairing the
causeway originally erected by Hugh Lupus.&nbsp; In 1646 an order
of Parliament was issued, that the mills and causeway should be
destroyed, as an obstruction to trade; but this order, issued by
the Puritans then in power, probably with no other view than to
obtain a <i>composition</i> from the proprietor, was <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>never
complied with.&nbsp; On the alienation of the Gamul property, the
greater part of the mills fell into the hands of Mr. Edward
Wrench, in whose successor the property is now vested.&nbsp; The
Dee Mills have been twice destroyed by fire within the last sixty
years.&nbsp; The first conflagration broke out about twelve at
night, of Saturday, September 26, 1789; the second, about the
same hour of Saturday night, March 6, 1819; on which latter
occasion the progress of the flames was so rapid, that the whole
of the premises, with the exception of part of the outward wall,
were destroyed in less than six hours.&nbsp; The loss sustained
was upwards of &pound;40,000.&nbsp; A third fire took place in
January, 1847, which destroyed the whole of one of the mills.</p>
<p>We shall now proceed to notice</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Old Bridgegate</span>,</h3>
<p>which appears to have been of equal antiquity with the bridge
itself, for it is shown by documents in the possession of the
Earl of Shrewsbury, that Randle, Earl of Chester, confirmed a
gift of his Countess to Poyns, her servant, of the custody of
this gate.&nbsp; And another deed, of the thirteenth century,
preserved among the same documents, records, &ldquo;quod ego
Ricardus Bagoth de Cestr: dedi et omnino quietam clamavi Philippo
clerico civi Cestr: <i>totum jus meum in porta pontis Cestr</i>:
cum omnibus pertinentijs suis.&rdquo;&nbsp; From Philip the clerk
the custody of this gate passed to the family of Raby, one of
whom, Philip de Raby, in the fourteenth century, had also the
keeping of the Earl&rsquo;s garden at the Castle, for which
service he received the fruit of a tree called &ldquo;a
<i>restynge tre</i>,&rdquo; and whatever remained on the other
trees after the first shaking, under the <i>reddendo</i> of
furnishing the Earl&rsquo;s household with colewort from
Michaelmas to Lent, and with leeks during Lent.&nbsp; From the
Rabys the custody of the Bridgegate passed to the Norrises of
Speke, in Lancashire, and the Troutbecks.&nbsp; In 1624 the
Corporation purchased the moiety belonging to the Norrises; and
in 1660 they also purchased the other moiety from the Earl of
Shrewsbury, representative of the Troutbecks, the Earl reserving
to himself, during his visits to Chester, the use of a suite of
apartments in a house near the gate.</p>
<p>The Old Gate consisted of an arched gateway, flanked with two
strong round towers, on one of which was erected a lofty
octagonal tower, containing a cistern for supplying the city with
water, called Tyrer&rsquo;s Water Works, concerning which Webb
says, &ldquo;The <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>Bridgegate hath of late been greatly beautified by a
seemly water-work of stone, built steeple-wise, by the ingenious
industry and charge of a late worthy member of the city, John
Tyrer, gent., and hath served ever since to great use, for the
conveying of the river water from the cistern, in the top of that
work, to the citizens&rsquo; houses in almost all the parts of
the city, in pipes of lead and wood, <i>to their no small
contentment and commodity</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The whole fabric was
taken down in 1781.</p>
<p>Proceeding eastward, a most pleasing view of the Dee, of
considerable extent, is presented, with delightful cottage and
villa residences on the Boughton bank, and in a pleasant suburb
called &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Park,&rdquo; the elegant suspension
bridge to which forms a novel feature in the landscape.&nbsp; On
the left of the river is a cool and shady walk, called <i>The
Groves</i>, where there are excellent pleasure boats for the
accommodation of those who enjoy a sail or a pull up the
river.&nbsp; We have here a very good view of St. John&rsquo;s
Church on the right, a venerable pile, containing some curious
and interesting specimens of Norman architecture.</p>
<p>Within about fifty yards of the Recorder&rsquo;s steps, the
wall forms an angle to the northward.&nbsp; Here we ascend six
flights of steps, consisting of three steps each, called the
<i>Wishing Steps</i>, erected in 1785, at the top of which stood
an ancient Watch Tower, which had formerly an apartment with a
stone seat on one side, and windows commanding a view of the
river and adjacent country.&nbsp; This room was removed in
1826.</p>
<p>We next arrive at</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Newgate</span>,</h3>
<p>a plain arched gateway, forming a communication betwixt
Newgate-street and Pepper-street within the Walls, and St.
John&rsquo;s-street, Dee-lane, &amp;c., without.&nbsp; On the
spot now occupied by this gate, formerly stood a postern, called
<i>Wolf&rsquo;s Gate</i>, or <i>Pepper Gate</i>.&nbsp; Of this
postern, Fuller says, that in the sixteenth century &ldquo;the
Mayor of the city had his daughter, as she was playing at ball
with other maidens in Pepper-street, stolen away by a young man
through the same gate, whereupon he caused it to be shut
up,&rdquo; which gave rise to the saying, &ldquo;When the
daughter is stolen, shut Pepper Gate.&rdquo;&nbsp; The postern
was removed and the Newgate erected in 1608.&nbsp; From a Journal
of the Siege of Chester, in King&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vale
Royal,&rsquo; it appears that on the 29th September, 1645,
&ldquo;the besiegers made a breach in the walls near to the
Newgate, <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>by the battery of 150 cannon shot, and at midnight made
a sharp assault upon the breach.&nbsp; They likewise attempted to
mount the walls with scaling ladders, but some officers and
several soldiers were hauled in over the walls; some of the
ladders, too, were dragged over, and many of the assailants
thrown down and killed, and the rest forced to give over the
attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short way further to the eastward, after passing the scanty
remains of an old tower abutting from the Walls, called
<i>Thimbleby&rsquo;s Tower</i>, we arrive at a flight of steps
leading to the Wesleyan Methodist Chapel in St.
John&rsquo;s-street, the access to which from this quarter was
made under the sanction of the Corporation.&nbsp; This handsome
and commodious place of worship was erected in 1811.&nbsp; Near
to the chapel is a large and commodious School-house, recently
erected, capable of containing from 200 to 300 children, which is
occupied during the week as a day school, and is in a prosperous
condition.</p>
<p>A few paces now brings us to</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Eastgate</span>,</h3>
<p>consisting of a wide and beautiful centre arch for the passage
of carriages, and two posterns for the safety and convenience of
foot passengers.&nbsp; It was built at the sole expense of the
late Marquis of Westminster, whose arms, and those of the city,
occupy the centre of the principal arch.&nbsp; On the 8th August,
1768, the south-west corner stone of the Eastgate was laid by
John Page, Esq., Provincial Grand Master, attended by four
regular lodges of Freemasons; and the north-west corner-stone by
the Mayor, Sheriffs, and Aldermen of Chester.&nbsp; On the east
side, under the Grosvenor armorial bearings, is the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">ERECTED AT THE EXPENSE OF</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">RICHARD LORD GROSVENOR,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">MDCCLXIX.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on the west side, under the city arms,</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="GutSmall">BEGUN A.D. MDCCLXVIII, JOHN
KELSALL,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">ESQ., MAYOR. FINISHED A.D.
MDCCLXIX,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">CHAS. BOSWELL, ESQ., MAYOR.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the summit of the gate there is a fine view of
Eastgate-street, within the walls, and Foregate, or Forest-street
on the outside.&nbsp; On a market day it is truly spirit-stirring
to observe the multitude beneath, and listen to the &ldquo;busy
hum of men,&rdquo; citizens and country folks, engaged in buying
and selling,&mdash;bringing in and <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>carrying out,&mdash;the various
commodities which furnish forth the provision market of a county
town.&nbsp; On the same spot formerly stood</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Old Eastgate</span>,</h3>
<p>removed in 1768, as too narrow and inconvenient for one of the
principal entrances to the city.&nbsp; It consisted of a
beautifully formed Gothic archway, flanked by two massive
octagonal embattled towers, connected by a substantial building,
two stories in height, over the gateway, the roof of which was
raised to a level with and embattled in the same manner as the
flanking towers to which it formed the centre.&nbsp; From the
bearings on four shields which ornamented the front of this gate,
it is conjectured to have been erected during the reign of Edward
III.</p>
<p>A Roman gateway appears to have occupied the same spot at a
still earlier period; for in pulling down the Old Eastgate in
1768, two wide circular arches of Roman architecture were
discovered within its workmanship.</p>
<p>With all due admiration for the spirit of useful improvement
which dictated the erection of the present Eastgate, we cannot
avoid expressing our regret that the old one no longer remains to
gratify the eye of the antiquary and the man of taste.&nbsp;
Although the present gate is undoubtedly much better adapted for
the entrance of carriages of all kinds, yet the Cestrians of the
last century, who remembered the glories of the old structure,
must have been but ill reconciled to its substitute.</p>
<p>Having thus completed the circuit of the Walls of Chester, as
they at present stand, it only remains to notice that there was
formerly an outer gate in Foregate-street, about half a mile from
the Eastgate, called</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Bars Gate</span>,</h3>
<p>which, being in a very dilapidated state, was removed as a
nuisance in 1770.&nbsp; An outwork, in connection with this gate,
was raised previous to the siege of Chester in 1643.&nbsp; This
outwork, consisting of a mud wall, fortified with mounts and
bastions, joined the City Wall at the New Tower, from whence it
stretched out to the north-east so far as to take in Upper
Northgate-street; then running eastward, encompassed all the
suburbs on the north of Foregate-street, until it approached
Boughton, when it turned southward, and proceeded in that
direction across Foregate-street at the Bars Gate, down Dee-lane,
at the bottom of which its course was terminated <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>by the
river.&nbsp; This outwork withstood a violent assault by the
Puritans under Sir William Brereton, on the 18th July, 1643,
wherein the assailants were forced to retire with great loss; but
on the 19th of September, 1645, it was surprised and carried by a
night assault of the enemy, under the command of General
Louthian, and was afterwards occupied by the Puritans as a
circumvallation, while prosecuting the siege of the city.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In perusing the foregoing sketch of our
Walls, with the incidental notices of contiguous objects, it is
presumed, that individuals most conversant with the localities of
the city, will meet with several particulars, either to gratify
their curiosity or add to their information.&nbsp; And it may
also be hoped, that should the account be read by those who are
strangers to our ancient fortifications, and the peculiar
attractions of Chester, it may excite a commendable
inquisitiveness for a personal survey, at the same time that it
may assist as a directory to their inquiries.&nbsp; In whatever
point of view these old ramparts are considered, they possess an
imposing interest, and confer incalculable benefits.&nbsp; To the
invalid, the sedentary student, or the man of business, occupied
during the day in his shop or counting-house; to the habitually
indolent, who require excitement to necessary exercise&mdash;to
all these, the promenade on Chester Walls has most inviting
attractions, where they may breathe all the salubrious winds of
heaven in a morning or an evening walk.&nbsp; Here the
enthusiastic antiquarian, who would climb mountains, ford rivers,
explore the bowels of the earth, and, regardless of toil and the
claims of nature, exhaust his strength in search of a piece of
rusty cankered brass, or a scrap of Roman earthenware, can
scarcely advance a dozen paces but the pavement on which he
treads, or some contiguous object, forces upon his observation
the relics of times of earliest date.&nbsp; Nor can the
philosophic moralist encompass our venerable walls without having
his mind, comparing the splendid and gigantic works of antiquity
with their present condition, strongly impressed with the
mutations produced by the lapse of ages, and the perishing nature
of all mundane greatness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall conclude this branch of our history by citing
the sentiments of a man well known to the republic of letters,
regarding our ancient city, not indeed particularly as to her
walls, but as to her general attractions.&nbsp; His information,
as a traveller, was varied and extensive, and his discernment and
intellect strong and acute.&nbsp; This gentleman, who was no
other than Mr. Boswell, in a letter to <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>Dr. Johnson, dated October 22, 1779,
says, &lsquo;Chester pleases me more than any town I ever
saw.&nbsp; I told a very pleasing young lady, niece to one of the
prebendaries (Miss Letitia Barnston), at whose house I saw her,
&lsquo;I have come to Chester, Madam, I cannot tell how; and far
less can I tell how to get away from it.&rsquo;&nbsp; Dr. Johnson
in reply says, &lsquo;In the place where you are there is much to
be observed, and you will easily procure yourself skilful
directors.&rsquo;&nbsp; In another letter, dated November 7, in
the same year, Boswell remarks, &lsquo;I was quite enchanted at
Chester, so that I could with difficulty quit it.&rsquo;&rdquo;

A WALK THROUGH THE CITY.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is our purpose now to conduct
the tourist through the city, that we may point out, in detail,
the various objects of interest which claim his attentive
inspection.&nbsp; But before commencing our perambulations
through the principal streets, we will here introduce a few
remarks on that unique feature which constitutes the
distinguishing attraction of Chester, and has given it universal
celebrity.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Rows</span>.</h3>
<p>Very curious are these old arcades, which are as interesting
to the antiquarian as they are convenient for a quiet lounge to
ladies and others engaged in shopping.&nbsp; They occupy the
greatest part of both sides of Eastgate-street, and the upper
parts of both sides of Watergate-street and Bridge-street.&nbsp;
Those in Northgate-street are more irregular, only one side,
commonly called Shoemakers&rsquo;-row, being used as a regular
thoroughfare.&nbsp; Their appearance, both interior and exterior,
is extremely singular.&nbsp; They form a gallery, occupying the
front floor of each house, parallel with the streets below, and
are approached by flights of steps, placed at convenient
distances, in addition to those by which they are entered and
quitted at each end.&nbsp; The passenger walks over the shops on
a level with the street, and under the first floor of the
dwelling-houses; and thus two lines of shops are erected in one
front.&nbsp; The rows are kept in excellent repair, and form the
chief promenade of the citizens.&nbsp; To strangers they cannot
fail to prove an object of curiosity.&nbsp; The shops in the rows
are generally considered the best situations for retail traders;
but those on the southern side of Eastgate-street and the eastern
side of Bridge-street have a decided preference.&nbsp; Shops let
here at high rents, and are in never-failing request; and there
are no parts of the city which have undergone such rapid or
extensive improvements.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century the rows appear not to have exceeded
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>6 feet in
height and 10 in width, with clumsy wooden rails towards the
street, and large oaken pillars, supporting transverse beams and
brackets, on which rested the houses over head, formed of wood
and plaster, so far overhanging the street, that in some places
the upper floors of opposite houses nearly met.&nbsp; Nearly the
whole of the buildings of this description are now taken down;
and in rebuilding care has been taken to raise and widen the
rows, and to place iron railings towards the street in place of
the wooden posts formerly used.&nbsp; The shops in the rows
present a very different appearance to that of about sixty years
ago; then, as Hemingway says, &ldquo;the fronts were all
<i>open</i> to the row in two or three compartments, according to
their size; and at night were closed by large hanging shutters
fixed on hinges, and fastened in the daytime by hooks to the
ceiling of the row.&rdquo;&nbsp; At present these rows are
&ldquo;capable of supplying all the real demands of convenience
and the artificial calls of luxury, mental and corporeal,
presenting a cluster of drapers, clothiers, jewellers,
booksellers, &amp;c., as respectable as the kingdom can
produce.&rdquo; <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a>&nbsp; The origin and cause of the rows
has furnished matter for much curious investigation; and many
conflicting conjectures have been propounded respecting
them.&nbsp; The subject is involved in much obscurity; and, in
the absence of any positive data, we are not able to take higher
ground than the probabilities of the case.&nbsp; It has been
alleged that they were originally used as places of defence, from
whence to annoy and repulse the assaults of the enemy, who might
gain entrance into the streets beneath by surprising the gates,
during those remote ages when Chester was subject to the sudden
incursions of the Welsh.&nbsp; But against this opinion it may be
urged, that in no one of their attacks upon this city did the
Welsh ever force their way within the gates or walls; so that
these latter, being proved by experience to be a sufficient
bulwark against our foes, there existed no necessity for the
erection of any further defences.&nbsp; There is irrefragable
evidence that the <i>form</i> of the city is Roman, and that the
<i>walls</i> were the work of that people; and the same reasons
which justify these conclusions are not less cogent for presuming
that the construction of the streets are Roman also.&nbsp;
Pennant appears to have arrived at this conclusion:&mdash;he
says, &ldquo;These rows appear to me to have been the same with
the ancient <i>vestibules</i>, and to have been a form of
building preserved from the time that the city was possessed by
the Romans.&nbsp; They were built before the <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>doors, midway
between the streets and the houses, and were the places where
dependants waited for the coming out of their patrons, and under
which they might walk away the tedious minutes of
expectation.&nbsp; Plautus, in the 3rd act of his
<i>Mostella</i>, describes both their station and use.&nbsp; The
shops beneath the rows were the Crypt&aelig; and Apothec&aelig;,
magazines for the various necessaries of the owners of the
houses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ormerod says that some of these crypts exhibit specimens of
vaulting equal to the cloisters of our Cathedral.</p>
<p>Camden, in describing Chester, says, &ldquo;The houses are
very fair built, and along the chief streets are galleries or
walking places they call rows, having shops on both sides,
through which a man may walk dry from one end to the
other.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Shukeley, in his &lsquo;Itinerary,&rsquo;
in 1724, says, &ldquo;The rows or piazzas are singular through
the whole town, giving shelter to foot people.&nbsp; I fancied it
a remain of the <i>Roman porticoes</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the oldest histories, descriptive of the city in some form
or other, the elevated rows and the shops beneath are
recognized.</p>
<p>Tacitus, &ldquo;in describing the process by which Roman
manners diffused themselves throughout Britain, and gradually
completed the subjugation of the country, speaks of the natives
of Britain as acquiring a taste for the two leading features in
Roman civilization, &lsquo;Porticus and Balnea,&rsquo;&mdash;the
portico, in which they were delighted to stroll and sun
themselves; and the baths, which were their national
luxury.&nbsp; He mentions these, and we cannot but be struck by
the coincidence with things with which we are all
familiar&mdash;the <i>rows</i> of our ancient city, and the
Hypocaust, which is still shown as the Roman bath.&nbsp; We are
hereby led to infer, that the mode of construction which gives
the character to our city, originated in Roman habits.&rdquo; <a
name="citation51"></a><a href="#footnote51"
class="citation">[51]</a></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Principal Streets</span>.</h3>
<p>Within the walls, the city is subdivided by four principal
streets, intersecting each other nearly at right angles at St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church, which stands in the centre of the
city.&nbsp; These streets retain numerous old timber buildings,
which give them an unusual and quaint appearance, and are wider
in general than those of cities of equal antiquity.&nbsp;
Immediately in front of the church formerly stood the High Cross,
which was pulled down and defaced by the Parliamentarians, when
they took possession of the city in 1646.&nbsp; <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>The upper
portion of this valuable antiquity is still preserved in the
grounds of Netherlegh House, though some of the carved figures
are a good deal injured.&nbsp; Mr. Pennant is of opinion that St.
Peter&rsquo;s Church, and a few houses to the north and west,
occupy the site of the <i>Roman Pr&aelig;torium</i>, with its
Court of Judicature and Angulale, where prayers, sacrifices, and
other religious rites were wont to be performed.</p>
<p>Adjoining the Cross formerly stood that ignominious instrument
of punishment, called the <i>Pillory</i>.</p>
<p>Adjoining the south side of St. Peter&rsquo;s Church stood the
old Pentice, where the magistrates performed their judicial
duties, where the sheriffs sat to determine civil causes, and
where the Town-office was kept, until the year 1803, when it was
removed for the purpose of widening the road into Northgate and
Watergate streets, at that time extremely narrow and
dangerous.&nbsp; The bench of magistrates was then removed to
much more commodious apartments in the Exchange.&nbsp; At the
corner of the east of Bridge-street and the west of
Eastgate-street, and near to the Cross, there was formerly a
small stone building, forming a basin at the top, called the
<i>Conduit</i>, to which water was formerly brought into the city
from St. Giles&rsquo;s well at Boughton, and thence conveyed to
different parts of the city.</p>
<p>The Cross used formerly to be the scene of the barbarous sport
of bull-baiting, of which the following satirical sketch is given
in an old History of Chester:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Cross is famous for being the annual
scene of exhibition of that <i>polite play</i> called a
bull-bait, where four or five of these <i>horned heroes</i> are
attended by several hundred lovers of that <i>rational
amusement</i>.&nbsp; Till within a few years, the <i>dramatis
person&aelig;</i> of this <i>elegant scene</i> included even
magistracy itself, the mayor and corporation attending in their
official habiliments, at the Pentice windows, not only to
countenance the <i>diversions</i> of the <i>ring</i>, but to
participate in a sight of its <i>enjoyments</i>.&nbsp; A
proclamation was also made, by the crier of the court, with all
the gravity and solemnity of an oration before a <i>Romish
sacrifice</i>; the elegant composition of which ran
thus&mdash;&lsquo;<i>Oyez</i>!&nbsp; <i>Oyez</i>!&nbsp;
<i>Oyez</i>!&nbsp; <i>If any man stands within twenty yards of
the bull-ring</i>, <i>let him take&mdash;what
comes</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; After which followed the usual public
ejaculations, for &lsquo;the safety of the king and the mayor of
the city;&rsquo; when the <i>beauties</i> of the scene commenced,
and the dogs immediately <i>fell to</i>.&nbsp; Here a prayer for
his worship was not unseasonable, as even the ermin&rsquo;d cloak
was <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>no
security against the carcases of dead animals, with which
spectators, without distinction, were occasionally saluted.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We shall not attempt a description of the
<i>tender</i> offices practised, at such times, on so noble a
creature&mdash;one, however, we cannot omit mentioning: in 1787,
an unfortunate animal, smarting under his wounds and fatigue, was
very <i>naturally</i> induced to <i>lie down</i>;&mdash;the
<i>argument</i> made use of, in this situation, however, <i>as
naturally</i> induced him to <i>get up</i>; his <i>humane</i>
followers hitting upon the ingenious expedient of setting fire to
some straw under his body, when, it is hardly necessary to add,
&lsquo;the wretched animal heav&rsquo;d forth such groans, as
stretch&rsquo;d his leathern coat almost to
bursting.&rsquo;&nbsp; This circumstance of the <i>fire</i> was,
however, no bad <i>satire</i> (emblematically considered) on the
transactions of the day&mdash;the whole being little better than
a&mdash;&lsquo;burning shame.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The late Dr. Cowper is said to have had the merit, when
mayor, of putting a stop to the attendance of the corporate body
on these days; and Mr. Alderman Brodhurst, in his mayoralty, made
a laudable but ineffectual effort to suppress a relic of
barbarism &lsquo;more honoured in the <i>breach</i> than the
<i>observance</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><span class="smcap">Eastgate Street</span>,</h3>
<p>a spacious street, forming a direct line to the Eastgate,
about 209 yards in length.&nbsp; The appearance of the street has
been considerably modernized of late years; many of the old
houses having been taken down, and spacious shops and
dwelling-houses erected on their site.&nbsp; There is a very
interesting old crypt to be seen on the premises of Messrs.
Prichard and Dodd, which furnishes an additional illustration of
the statement, that many of the buildings in the principal
streets are erected on the remains of ancient religious
houses.&nbsp; Dr. Ormerod gives it as his opinion that these
conventual buildings occupied nearly, if not wholly, one-fourth
of the city.&nbsp; The handsome premises occupied by Mr. Hugh
Roberts, bookseller, and by Mr. Bolland, confectioner, have
latterly been rebuilt in an elegantly appropriate style of
architecture: and Messrs. Brown are now (1858) erecting a
splendid range of shops.&nbsp; About two-thirds down the street
on the right is Newgate-street; and opposite is St.
Werburgh&rsquo;s-street, leading to the Cathedral.&nbsp; There
are two excellent inns in Eastgate-street&mdash;the Green Dragon
and the Royal Hotel; the latter being a large and lofty edifice,
the front resting on round stone pillars, between <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>which, and
the coffee-room there is a capacious piazza.&nbsp; Passing under
the arch of the Eastgate, you enter</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Foregate Street</span>,</h3>
<p>a spacious airy street, about 572 yards in length, and in most
parts 18 in breadth; on the right hand is St. John-street, in
which is situated the Post-office, and a little lower down the
Mechanics&rsquo; Institution and News-room.&nbsp; The spacious
circular building is a place of worship used by the Wesley an
Methodists.&nbsp; The narrow street on the left leads to St.
John&rsquo;s Church and Priory, which will amply repay a careful
and attentive study.&nbsp; Returning to the Cross, we now proceed
down</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Watergate Street</span>,</h3>
<p>which possesses remarkable interest, from the number of very
old houses still remaining in it.&nbsp; This street has perhaps
suffered less from the innovation of modern improvement than any
other part of Chester.&nbsp; The rows on both sides extend nearly
to the bottom of the street, and retain several marks of great
antiquity.&nbsp; In front of an old house on the south side of
the street, there is a post, with the date 1539 carved upon
it.&nbsp; On the same side, nearer the Cross, is an old
dwelling-house, with the inscription&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;God&rsquo;s
Providence is mine Inheritance&mdash;1652,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>cut upon a beam in front, in legible characters.&nbsp; At the
time when the plague was devastating the city, this was almost
the only house which was exempt from its destructive havoc.&nbsp;
Gratefully sensible of this singular blessing, the pious occupier
placed this inscription on the front of his house, as a
commemorative memorial of Divine Providence.&nbsp; Lower down, on
the same side, is a singularly decorated old house, having the
whole front divided into square compartments, filled with carved
work of various descriptions, principally heraldry and scripture
history.&nbsp; Adam and Eve;&mdash;Cain killing
Abel;&mdash;Abraham offering up Isaac;&mdash;Susannah and the
Elders&mdash;and a Martyrdom, are the principal subjects.&nbsp;
There are three other compartments, two of them consisting of
armorial bearings, including the Earldoms of Chester and Derby,
crested with a bishop&rsquo;s mitre; the third bears an
inscription, illegible from the street, and the date 1613.&nbsp;
This house was built by Dr. George Lloyd, of the family of Lloyd
of Kinmell, in North Wales, Bishop of Chester from 1604 to
1615.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Lower down, on the same side of the street, below
Nicholas-street, <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>is a curious and spacious old palace, once the mansion
of the Derby family, which is well deserving of the
visitor&rsquo;s notice.&nbsp; It is approached through a narrow
passage.&nbsp; The front of the house presents some interesting
specimens of curiously ornamental carved work.&nbsp; On this spot
once stood a <i>Monastery</i> of the order of Black Friars.</p>
<p>The street on the opposite side leads to the new Linen Hall,
where the cheese fairs are periodically held.&nbsp; It was built
by the Irish merchants in 1778.&nbsp; At that time the imports of
linen were very considerable, and a large business was done.</p>
<p>At the corner of this street stands her Majesty&rsquo;s Custom
House.&nbsp; Adjoining is Trinity Church, which contains the
mortal remains of Parnell the poet, and Matthew Henry,
immortalized in his far-famed commentary.&nbsp; Trinity-street
contains nothing worthy of special notice: it leads, however, to
a memorable spot, of surpassing interest to all who love to trace
the &ldquo;records of a good man&rsquo;s life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Higher up is Crook-street, where stands the chapel built for
Matthew Henry.&nbsp; These chapel walls once echoed the voice of
that eloquent man, who assiduously asserted the pure principles
of the Gospel.&nbsp; Associated, therefore, as the place is with
the memory of a great mind, whose works have taken an honourable
position in the religious literature of the country, it cannot
but be an attraction to all who love to treasure the incidents
which mark the biography of an eminent and a worthy man.&nbsp;
Matthew Henry&rsquo;s chapel is now occupied by the
Unitarians.</p>
<p>Returning to the Cross, we proceed to</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Northgate Street</span>,</h3>
<p>which forms the northern division of the city, and is 440
yards long.&nbsp; On the east side, adjoining St. Peter&rsquo;s
Church, are the Commercial-buildings, occupied as a subscription
News-room, and the Library of the Arch&aelig;ological
Society.&nbsp; The rows in Northgate-street are chiefly formed of
wood; that on the west is the only one in general use, extending
from the Cross to the Fish Market.&nbsp; The regular market for
&ldquo;Fish and vegetables,&rdquo; says a History of Chester,
1791, &ldquo;is in the square opposite the Exchange, which, in
general, are plentiful and reasonable.&nbsp; In that useful
article, salmon, no market in the kingdom did, some few years
ago, excel it; indeed, such was the profusion of this valuable
fish, that masters were often restricted, by a clause of
indenture, from giving it more than twice a week to their
apprentices!&nbsp; Though the <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>bounty of Providence, in this
particular, is yet unabated, such restriction is no longer
necessary&mdash;some <i>artificial</i> cause or other very
<i>kindly</i> rendering this fish, at the present day, a
<i>delicacy</i> even to the <i>masters</i> themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Exchange</span></h3>
<p>is situated in the Market-place, on the west side of
Northgate-street.&nbsp; It was commenced in 1695, and completed
in 1698, at an expense of &pound;1,000, towards which Roger
Whitley, then Mayor, contributed largely.&nbsp; It is a good
brick building, ornamented with stone-work, supported by stone
pillars on the ground floor, through which is a thoroughfare from
south to north.&nbsp; In a niche on the south front is a statue
of Queen Anne in her coronation robes.&nbsp; On the right of this
statue is a tablet, having the arms of the Earldom of Chester on
a circular shield in the centre, and above these the coats of the
Principality of Wales and Duchy of Cornwall, having each their
respective coronets over them.&nbsp; The blazon of this tablet is
believed to have been furnished by the last Randle Holmes, Deputy
Norroy King at Arms, who died in 1707.&nbsp; On the left of the
statue is another tablet, containing the Royal arms of England as
borne by Queen Anne.&nbsp; The centre of the building is occupied
by the <i>Common Hall</i>, wherein are held the city sessions and
the elections for members of parliament for the borough.&nbsp;
The north end of the Common Hall is fitted up as a court of
justice, having a bench, bar, witness and jury boxes.&nbsp; On
each side of the bench are ornaments, composed of lictors&rsquo;
fasces and spears, used to support the sword and mace.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Adjoining and communicating with the Common Hall on the north
is the Council-room, commonly called the <i>Pentice</i>, where
the mayor and magistrates sit as a court of Petty Sessions.&nbsp;
Over the mayor&rsquo;s seat in this room is a splendid full
length portrait of George the Third in his coronation
robes,&mdash;the figure by Gainsborough, the drapery by
Reynolds,&mdash;presented to the city by the late Marquis of
Westminster, in 1808.&nbsp; On the south side of the
Exchange-buildings is the City Assembly-room, where the meetings
of the Town Council are held.&nbsp; The Town Hall, the Pentice
Court, and the Assembly-room, are all decorated with fine
portraits of benefactors to the city, and of eminent men who have
been officially engaged in its highest legal appointments, or in
the administration of its municipal affairs.&nbsp; Among these
worthies may be seen the donors of local charities, and other
celebrities; as <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

their robes of the civic mayoralty, painted by West; W. Cross,
Esq., first Mayor after the passing of the Municipal Reform Act;
and W. Wardell, Esq., Mayor in 1841.&nbsp; At the north end of
the Exchange is the Market, appropriated for the sale of butter;
and a few yards apart is another building of equal breadth, but
longer, for butchers&rsquo; meat, both of which are neatly fitted
up and well adapted for their respective purposes.&nbsp; We
recommend the tourist now to continue his walk up the street, for
the purpose of visiting the Training College, which, we doubt
not, our former description has made him curious to see.&nbsp;
Supposing this to have been done, we now return on the east side,
passing through the Northgate about 100 yards, where we come to a
narrow avenue on the left, under an old archway, the remains of
one of the gates of the monastery of St. Werburgh.&nbsp; A little
further down, opposite the Market-hall, stands a noble arch
called</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Abbey Gate</span>,</h3>
<p>which is a Gothic pointed arch, with a postern at the side,
both of which are included in a larger obtuse one, apparently of
the same order.&nbsp; The interior of the gateway is vaulted with
stone, with ribs, and carved keystones at the intersections; and
the rooms over were originally approached by a spiral
staircase.&nbsp; On the south side was the porter&rsquo;s lodge,
and on the other St. Thomas&rsquo;s-court.&nbsp; Before this gate
were anciently raised the booths for the merchants frequenting
the Abbot&rsquo;s fair; these booths were covered with reeds,
which the monks were empowered to gather from Stanlaw Marsh; and
here also the performers in the Chester Mysteries commenced the
exhibition of their pageants.&nbsp; This was formerly the grand
entrance into the monastery, which appears to have occupied a
very extensive range.&nbsp; On passing through the arched gateway
we enter into the Abbey-square.&nbsp; On the right hand is a
wall, enclosing the episcopal palace, which was rebuilt by Bishop
Keene, out of his private resources, at an expense of
&pound;2,200, soon after his promotion to the see in 1752.&nbsp;
In former days the residence <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>of the Abbots of St. Werburgh stood
on this site.&nbsp; The spacious edifice at the end of the palace
wall is the Registry Office, of which Dickens has given an
interesting sketch in his &lsquo;Household Words,&rsquo; in one
of his able papers, entitled, &lsquo;The Doom of English
Wills.&rsquo;&nbsp; The entire arrangements and management of the
office are described in terms of unqualified commendation, highly
complimentary to the talented registrar, who is described as
&ldquo;a gentleman who fulfils the duties of his office in person
with assiduity.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the centre of the square is a
shrubbery, enclosed with an iron palisading, having in the centre
an elliptic column, which was once a pillar under the Exchange;
but on removing it to build a shop there, the Corporation
presented it to the Dean and Chapter, who appropriated it to its
present use.&nbsp; In the north-east angle of the square is the
Deanery, built on the site where once stood an old Gothic
structure, called St. Thomas&rsquo;s Chapel.&nbsp; Returning into
Northgate-street, the next narrow avenue on the left gives us a
fine view of the west transept of the Cathedral, with its
beautiful window, enriched with elegant tracery.&nbsp; A few
paces below we arrive at</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Music Hall</span>, formerly <span
class="smcap">The Theatre Royal</span>.</h3>
<p>The citizens of Chester appear to have been early
distinguished for a love of theatricals.&nbsp; From a MS.
entitled, &ldquo;Certayne collections of aunchiante times
concerninge the aunchiante and famous Citty of Chester,&rdquo; by
Archdeacon Rogers, we learn that in the beginning of the
fourteenth century, Randal Higden, a monk of Chester,
&ldquo;translated the Bible into several partes and plays, so as
the common people might learne the same by theyre
playinge.&rdquo;&nbsp; These <i>spectacles</i>, then called the
<i>Whitsun Plays</i>, were first performed in 1328, during the
mayoralty of Sir John Arneway, at the expense of the city
companies; and being &ldquo;profitable for them, for all both far
and near came to see them,&rdquo; they were repeated annually on
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in Whitsun week, for nearly 250
years, until 1574, when they were suppressed by authority.&nbsp;
The theatre for these performances was of the original Thespian
cast, a four-wheeled scaffold or waggon, whereof the body served
for a tyring room, and the roof for the stage, whereon the
members of the different city companies did &ldquo;each man play
his part.&rdquo;&nbsp; The first place of performance was at the
Abbey Gate, that &ldquo;the monks and churche might have the
first sighte, and then the stage was drawne to the High Crosse
before <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>the
Mayor and Aldermen, and soe from streete to streete; and when one
pageant was ended another came in the place thereof, till all
that were appoynted for the daye were ended.&rdquo;&nbsp; Each
company had its own peculiar parts allotted to its members to
perform in the Whitsun Plays, of which a list is given in the
above quoted MS.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>In addition to the Whitsun Plays, the citizens were anciently
entertained with processional pageants by the different
companies, which latter appear to have survived the suppression
of the former for many years.&nbsp; They were suppressed for some
time by the party in power during the Commonwealth, but revived
with great splendour at the Restoration.</p>
<p>The pageants were abolished by order of the Corporation in
1678.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No circumstance,&rdquo; says the old History from which
we have already quoted, &ldquo;can evince the strange mutations
to which things are liable, more than this place, which was
originally a <i>chapel</i> dedicated to <i>St. Nicholas</i>, and
devoted to <i>religion</i>; afterwards a <i>common hall</i>
devoted to <i>justice</i>; next a <i>warehouse</i> devoted to
<i>trade</i>; and now a <i>playhouse</i> devoted to
<i>amusement</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present writer has to note another change: the
&ldquo;Playhouse&rdquo; has become a <span class="smcap">Music
Hall</span>, handsome and commodious.&nbsp; A few years since a
company was formed for the purpose of erecting a spacious Hall,
available for musical and literary recreations, public meetings,
and social celebrations.&nbsp; The Hall was built by Mr. J. D.
Williams, from designs by Mr. James Harrison; and a remarkably
fine organ, by Jackson, of Liverpool, has also been
erected.&nbsp; Seats are fitted up for an audience of 1,400
persons, and the orchestra is capable of accommodating 300
performers.&nbsp; The cost of the building, with the organ and
fittings, was &pound;5,000.&nbsp; The Hall was opened, on
November 26th, 1855, with a grand Miscellaneous Concert, at which
Madame Clara Novello was the principal vocalist, and was crowded
by a brilliant gathering of the beauty and fashion of the city
and neighbourhood.&nbsp; Since that time it has frequently been
used for the performance of oratorios and concerts, for lectures,
public meetings, and other purposes, except theatrical
entertainments, which are prohibited by the terms of the lease
under which the site is held from the ecclesiastical
commissioners, in whom the fee simple of the property is
vested.</p>
<p>Returning to the Cross, whence we set out, we now direct our
attention to</p>
<h3><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span><span
class="smcap">Bridge Street</span>,</h3>
<p>which is an open and spacious street, in length from the Cross
to the Bridge about 554 yards.&nbsp; This street is characterized
by many striking features of deep interest to the antiquarian,
and indeed to all who love to visit the localities which are
associated with any remarkable events of our national and
ecclesiastical history.&nbsp; Although the buildings now present
a much more modern aspect than they did some years ago, there are
still remaining many conspicuous proofs of the antiquity of the
city, and many curious remains which give it peculiar
attractions.</p>
<p>A little way down the street, on the left hand, is a house now
occupied by Mr. W. Brittain, woollen draper, which is rendered
remarkable from a peculiar, and, as it resulted, <i>fortunate</i>
incident, which occurred there in 1558.&nbsp; In that year Dr.
Cole, Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s, came to Chester on his way to
Ireland, entrusted with a commission from Queen Mary, for
prosecuting the Protestants in that part of the kingdom.&nbsp;
The commissioner stopped one night in this house on his way, then
a noted inn, called the <i>Blue Posts</i>, where he was visited
by the Mayor, to whom, in the course of conversation, he
communicated his errand, taking out a leather box out of his
cloak bag, and saying, in a tone of exultation, &ldquo;Here is
what will lash the heretics of Ireland!&rdquo;&nbsp; This
announcement was overheard by the landlady of the house, who had
a brother in Dublin; and whilst the commissioner was
complimenting his worship down stairs, the good woman, prompted
by a tender regard for the safety of her brother, opened the box,
and taking out the commission, placed in its stead a pack of
cards, with the knave of clubs uppermost.&nbsp; The unsuspecting
Doctor packed up the box again, and with its far different
contents proceeded on his journey.&nbsp; On his arrival at the
Castle of Dublin, the precious box was presented to the Lord
Deputy and Privy Council, who, on opening it, found, in the place
of the commission, the pack of cards, prefaced with the
significant <i>knave of clubs</i>.&nbsp; The surprise of the
assembly was of course very great, and the Doctor&rsquo;s perhaps
the greatest of all; he was not lack in his protestations that
the commission he <i>had</i> received, and was entirely ignorant
how it had disappeared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us have another
commission,&rdquo; said the Deputy; and forthwith the amazed and
chagrined commissioner returned to Court for the purpose; but
before he could return to Ireland, Queen Mary died.&nbsp;
Elizabeth, her successor, rewarded the woman, <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>whose name
was Elizabeth Edwards, with a pension of &pound;40 a year during
her life.</p>
<p>A little lower down, on the same side, are the remains of a
Roman Bath and Hypocaust, which we have described under the head
of &ldquo;Roman Antiquities.&rdquo;&nbsp; This curious relic, we
take for granted, the visitor will &ldquo;go and see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little further is the neat little church of St. Michael,
recently erected on the site of the old church, which had become
so much dilapidated, that apprehensions were excited for its
safety.</p>
<p>Passing Pepper-street, adjoining St. Michael&rsquo;s, we next
meet with <span class="smcap">The Albion Hotel</span>, a
capacious building, connected with which is an Assembly-room, and
behind the premises extensive pleasure-grounds and a
bowling-green.</p>
<p>Passing on to the lower end of the street, we come to St.
Olave&rsquo;s Church, an edifice of very mean pretensions, but of
very ancient foundation.&nbsp; In the copy of an old Court Roll,
the advowson of St. Olave&rsquo;s is mentioned among other
advowsons, belonging to the Abbey of St. Werburgh.&nbsp; A clerk
was instituted and inducted upon the presentation of the Abbey,
in the time of King John.&nbsp; Divine service is discontinued at
St. Olave&rsquo;s, and the parishioners attend St.
Michael&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Continuing down the street we arrive at a
handsome arch called the Bridgegate, beyond which is the old
bridge, which will lead the tourist (should his curiosity incline
him) to Edgar&rsquo;s Cave, already described under the head of
antiquities.</p>
<p>Returning on the west side of the street, we come to a steep
lane, called St. Mary&rsquo;s-hill, which leads to the Castle and
to St. Mary&rsquo;s Church, a most interesting edifice, worthy of
the tourist&rsquo;s examination.</p>
<p>Opposite St. Olave&rsquo;s Church, before mentioned, is an old
house, formerly occupied by the Gamul family, which possesses
great interest from the fact of its having given protection to
Charles I. during the siege of Chester by the Parliamentary
forces.&nbsp; There is some very curious painted panel work and
beautiful carving in the interior, which render it well worthy of
inspection.&nbsp; A little higher up is an antiquated building
called &ldquo;The Falcon Inn,&rdquo; a fine specimen of the old
timber houses of Chester.&nbsp; Adjoining this house formerly
stood the <span class="smcap">Old Lamb Row</span>, which was one
of the most remarkable objects of curiosity in the city.&nbsp;
The materials of which the buildings were composed were the same
as that of the Falcon, which is probably an older building than
the Old <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Lamb-row was.&nbsp; It was constructed of massy beams of
oak, heavy roofs, and the interstices of the timber in the fronts
filled up with sticks and clay.&nbsp; The age of the row is
pretty clearly determined by the inscription on a stone,
discovered after the fall of the building:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">16&mdash;H&mdash;55<br
/>
R. H.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The initials of Randle Holme, the builder.&nbsp; This was the
mansion of the family of Holme, the famous Cheshire
antiquaries.&nbsp; In the year 1670, the third Randle made some
important and obnoxious alterations, which brought upon him the
censure of the Corporation, who ordered that &ldquo;the nuisance
erected by Randle Holme in his new building in Bridge-street,
near to the two churches, be taken down, as it annoys his
neighbours, and hinders their prospect from their
houses.&rdquo;&nbsp; He proceeded with his work, however, <i>sans
c&eacute;r&eacute;monie</i>; and in the following year Mr. Holme,
painter, &ldquo;was fined &pound;3 6s. 8d. for contempt to the
Mayor, in <i>proceeding</i> in his building in
Bridge-street.&rdquo;&nbsp; It continued the residence of that
heraldic family so late as 1707.&nbsp; It appears that the Holme
family subsequently sank into extreme indigence, and at no very
distant period, we believe, a descendant was an occasional boots
and waiter at a tavern in Liverpool.&nbsp; Such are the reverses
of fortune!&nbsp; How this property became alienated from the
Holmeses has not been ascertained.&nbsp; It was occupied about
the middle of the last century as a public-house, called
&ldquo;The Lamb,&rdquo; whence it derived the name of the
Lamb-row.&nbsp; In 1821, in the middle of the day, it suddenly
gave way and tumbled into the street: happily without any injury
to the inhabitants.&nbsp; An old woman was sitting in the upper
room at the moment the overhanging roof bore down the trembling
building beneath; the wall of the apartment separated within six
inches of a chair on which she was seated, but she fortunately
escaped.</p>
<p>After passing Grosvenor-street, we come to White Friars, which
derives its name from a monastery of Carmelites or White Friars
being once located there.&nbsp; The next turning is Common
Hall-street, so called from its being the place where the Common
Hall of the city formerly stood, as its name imports.&nbsp; Some
think that it occupied the site of a building now used as a
Dissenting chapel; but Ormerod is of opinion that it stood on the
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span><i>south</i> side of the street, near to several old
almshouses which still remain.</p>
<p>Prior to the era of the Reformation, Chester abounded in
religious institutions and edifices.&nbsp; We have already
indicated this fact, in pointing out the localities where some of
these religious buildings were situated.&nbsp; There are many
convincing evidences, in the lower part of several houses in the
principal streets, that they have been erected on the ruins of
these ecclesiastical foundations.&nbsp; A remarkable instance in
support of this supposition has recently been brought to light,
upon clearing out an underground cellar behind the shop of
Messrs. Powell and Edwards, cutlers, a little farther up in the
street, when the remains of</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">An Ancient Chapel</span></h3>
<p>were discovered.&nbsp; The public are much indebted to the
care and good taste of these gentlemen, that this valuable
antiquity has been so admirably preserved; and as they are most
courteous in affording strangers the privilege of examining it,
we doubt not that the opportunity will be gladly taken.&nbsp; The
chapel is of an oblong form, running from east to west.&nbsp; Its
dimensions are 42 feet in length, 15 feet 3 inches in breadth,
and the height, from the surface of the floor to the
intersections of the groining of the roof, 14 feet.&nbsp; It was
partially lighted through the upper part of the west end, in
which there are three small windows, divided by stone mullions,
and protected by iron bars.&nbsp; On examining the intersection
of the groins, marks were discovered on the stonework, that a
couple of lamps had been used for lighting.&nbsp; The entrance to
the east end was by a flight of steps cut out of the rock; this
passage is now closed, but from what remains there is no doubt
this was the case.&nbsp; On the south side is an
Anglo-Norman-Gothic doorway, attained by three or four circular
steps, and forming an outlet within its inner and outer wall, by
another flight of steps, to the surface above the building.&nbsp;
At the west end are two niches, in which the baptismal fonts are
supposed to have been placed; one of these was found during the
excavation, and is deposited in one of these recesses; the other
was unfortunately destroyed by the workmen.&nbsp; The date of the
erection of this interesting structure is supposed to be early in
the thirteenth century.&nbsp; Taking into consideration the fact
that not far from this spot were the monasteries of Grey Friars
and White Friars, it has been conjectured by some that in this
chapel they assembled for <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>their religious celebrations.&nbsp;
It seems to be, however, a more feasible hypothesis, that the
site was once occupied by some order of religious house; that the
chapel formed a part of the erection, and was used by the inmates
for their religious ceremonies and worship.&nbsp; In the upper
part of the premises there appear to be some characteristic
remains of the ancient structure.&nbsp; Lacking any further
evidence as to the character and extent of this venerable
building than the place itself supplies, the question is involved
in uncertainty.&nbsp; The crypt is a most interesting curiosity,
worthy of the investigation of the antiquarian, and to his better
judgment we leave the subject.</p>

65</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
CHESTER CATHEDRAL.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Previous</span> to the Roman conquests,
the Britons were accustomed to celebrate the rites of Druidism;
but as it was the custom of the Romans to carry into the lands
they conquered not only their civil polity, but also their
religion, the gods of the Pantheon became consequently the gods
of our ancestors.&nbsp; Near the existing memorials of Druidical
superstition there arose the majestic fanes of a more polished
mythology.&nbsp; At Bath there is said to have been a temple
dedicated to Minerva, while on the site now occupied by the
splendid cathedral of St. Paul there was a temple to Diana.&nbsp;
It appears, from a passage in King&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vale
Royal,&rsquo; there was a tradition generally accepted in his
day, that on the present site of Chester Cathedral was a temple
dedicated to Apollo, during the period that the city was
inhabited by the Legionaries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;from a scholar
residing in the city, when I was there, anno 1653, that there was
a temple dedicated to Apollo in olden time, in a place adjoining
to the Cathedral Church, by the constant tradition of the
learned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We are not aware that the supposition is capable of being
verified by any existing record; but when we take into
consideration the policy generally pursued by the Romans in
subjugating a country, it seems to be countenanced by strong
probability.&nbsp; With this form of Paganism, however, there
came zealous men, of true apostolic stamp, whose earnest
inculcation of vital principles accelerated the progress of a
better faith.&nbsp; So conspicuous had that progress become early
in the third century, that Tertullian, in his work written
against the Jews, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 209, states
that &ldquo;even those places in Britain hitherto inaccessible to
the Roman arms, have been subdued by the gospel of
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ground on which the temple of Apollo once stood (if the
tradition be trustworthy) was occupied, early in the second
century, <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>by a monastery dedicated to St. Peter and St. Paul,
&ldquo;which was the mother church and burial place to all
Chester, and seven miles about Chester, and so continued for the
space of three hundred years and more.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this
monastery (according to Bradshaw the monk) the relics of St.
Werburgh, daughter of Wulphere, King of Mercia, were removed from
Hanbury in 875, for fear of an incursion of the Danes, and here
re-buried with great pomp; a ceremony usually called &ldquo;the
translation of the body.&rdquo;&nbsp; The same author informs us
that the army of Griffin, King of Wales, was stricken with
blindness for their sacrilegious boldness, in attempting to
disturb these sainted remains.&nbsp; This, and other reputed
miracles of St. Werburgh, appear to have induced the celebrated
Ethelfleda, Countess of Mercia, to translate the monastery of St.
Peter and St. Paul to the centre of the city, and to erect on its
site a convent or monastery of secular nuns, dedicated to St.
Werburgh and St. Oswald.&nbsp; Earl Leofric was a great
benefactor to this foundation, having repaired its decayed
buildings at his own expense: and in 1093, when (says Rodolphus
Glaber) &ldquo;princes strove <i>&agrave; vie</i> that cathedral
churches and minsters should be erected in a more decent and
seemly form, and when Christendom roused, as it were, herself,
and, casting away her old habiliments, did put on every where the
bright and white robe of the churches.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hugh Lupus
expelled the canons secular, and laid the foundation of a
magnificent building, the remains of which are still existing; it
was established by him as an Abbey of Benedictine Monks from Bec
in Normandy, to pray (as the foundation charter expresses it)
&ldquo;for the soul of William their King, and those of King
William his most noble father, his mother Queen Maud, his
brothers and sisters, King Edward the Confessor, themselves the
founders, and those of their fathers, mothers, antecessors,
heirs, parents, and barons, and of all Christians as well living
as deceased.&rdquo;&nbsp; The confirmation charter by the second
Ranulf (surnamed De Gernon or Gernons), Earl of Chester, in which
the grant of Hugh Lupus is recapitulated, is in the possession of
the Marquis of Westminster, by whose kindness this most important
and interesting instrument has been lent for the use of the
Arch&aelig;ological Association, and has been published in the
pages of their journal.&nbsp; It is most beautifully written in
columns or pages, for the facility of reading.&nbsp; The charter
occupies nine, and commences with the copy of the original grant
of &ldquo;Hugone Cestreasi comite, anno ab incarnatione Domini
millesimo nonugesimo&rdquo; to the Abbey of St. Werburgh, which
was witnessed by <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Anselm, Archbishop of Canterbury, followed by the grants
of several of the other witnesses, and it concludes by the
confirmation of them all by the second Ranulf: (Ego secundus
Ranulfus comes &ldquo;Cestrie concedo et confirmo hos omnibus
donationes quos mei antecessores vel barones eor&rsquo;m
dederunt,&rdquo;) with additional grants from himself.&nbsp;
Anselm, Abbot of Bec, afterward Archbishop of Canterbury,
regulated the new foundation, and appointed Richard, his
chaplain, the first abbot.</p>
<p>Hugh Lupus, following the example of most of his predecessors,
lived a life of the wildest luxury and rapine.&nbsp; At length,
falling sick from the consequence of his excesses, and age and
disease coming on, the old hardened soldier was struck with
remorse; and&mdash;an expiation common enough in those
days&mdash;the great Hugh Lupus took the cowl, retired in the
last state of disease into the monastery, and in three days was
no more.</p>
<p>The Abbey was so richly endowed by the founder and his
successors, that at the dissolution its revenues amounted to no
less a sum than &pound;1,073 17s. 7d. per annum.</p>
<p>On the general dissolution of the monasteries, Chester was
erected into an independent bishopric, and St. Werburgh&rsquo;s
was converted into a Cathedral Church, which it has ever since
remained.&nbsp; It was dedicated to Christ and the Blessed Virgin
Mary; and a dean and six prebendaries installed in it, Thomas
Clarke, the last abbot, being appointed the first dean.</p>
<p>The principal portions of this venerable pile have been
erected at different periods from the fourteenth to the sixteenth
century, although there are some parts which bear indubitable
marks of a much earlier origin; the greater part, perhaps,
belongs to the fourteenth or fifteenth century, when the richly
decorated style of Gothic architecture was at its zenith in this
country.&nbsp; The Cathedral, from whatever side it is viewed,
presents a massive appearance, and exhibits a pleasing variety of
styles, in accordance with the taste of different ages.&nbsp; Mr.
Asphitel has said that he found beauties which grew on him more
and more at every visit.&nbsp; The Norman remains are extremely
fine&mdash;there is work of all kinds of great beauty&mdash;and
there are the most curious and instructive transitions from style
to style that perhaps were ever contained in one building.</p>
<p>Its general style may be termed the Norman-Gothic.&nbsp; It
has been generally supposed that there are also some remaining
specimens of the Saxon; but Mr. Asphitel, in an interesting <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>lecture
delivered before the British Arch&aelig;ological Association,
stated that he could not, from the most minute research, discover
any portion of the Saxon church; he considered it possible there
might be some portions in the foundations, but none were
visible.</p>
<p>The west front is said to have been the work of Abbot Ripley,
who was appointed to the abbacy in 1485.&nbsp; It is now in an
unfinished state, and it seems more than probable that there was
an intention to form two western towers.&nbsp; The foundation of
them was laid with much ceremony by Abbot Birchensaw in 1508, the
Mayor being then present; but the project was abandoned, most
likely for want of funds: had the original design been executed,
says Winkle, it would not have been very imposing.&nbsp; The west
entrance is a singular and beautiful composition: the door itself
is a Tudor arch, enclosed within a square head; the spandrils are
filled with rich and elegant foliations; the hollow moulding on
the top is deep and broad, and filled with a row of angels,
half-lengths; all this is recessed within another Tudor arch,
under another square head, with plain spandrils of ordinary
panelling.&nbsp; On each side of the door are four niches, with
their usual accompaniments of crocketted canopies, pinnacles, and
pendants; and instead of brackets, the statues formerly stood on
pedestals, with good bases and capitals.&nbsp; Above this
entrance is the great western window of the nave, deeply and
richly recessed; it is of eight lights, with elaborate tracery of
the kind most common in the latest age of the pointed
style.&nbsp; The arch of the window is much depressed, and has
above it a flowing crocketted canopy; the gable has no parapet,
but is finished off with a simple coping; the flanking-turrets
are octagonal, and have belts of panelled tracery and embattled
parapets.&nbsp; Leaving the west front, and turning to the south,
a rich and deep porch presents itself behind the Consistory
Court; the porch is flanked by buttresses, which once had
pinnacles.&nbsp; The entrance is under a Tudor arch within a
square head, the spandrils richly panelled; over the square head
is a broad belt of quatrefoil panelling; above that a hollow
moulding, adorned with the Tudor flower; above this are two
flat-headed windows of two lights each, with a deep niche between
them, resting on a projecting bracket; the statue is of course
gone, but the projecting and richly decorated canopy remains, on
both sides of which the wall above is adorned with two rows of
panelling; the open embattled parapet, which once crowned the
whole, has disappeared.&nbsp; The south side of the nave and its
aisle is plain, but not without dignity; the windows <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>are all
pointed, and of perpendicular character; those of the aisle have
straight canopies, with projecting buttresses between, which
still have niches, and once had both pinnacles and statues; the
aisle has no parapet.&nbsp; The windows of the clerestory are
unusually large and lofty, and their canopies are flowing in
form, but perfectly plain and without finials; they have no
buttresses between them, and the parapet is very shallow and
quite plain.</p>
<p>The next feature of the Cathedral is a very singular one, and,
indeed, unique&mdash;viz., the south wing of the transept.&nbsp;
It is no uncommon case to find the two portions of the transept
unlike each other in some respects; but in no other instance are
they so perfectly dissimilar as at Chester.&nbsp; Here the south
wing is nearly as long as the nave, and of equal length with the
choir, and considerably broader than either, having, like them,
aisles on both sides; while the north, which probably stands on
the original foundations, has no aisles, is very short, and only
just the breadth of one side of the central tower.&nbsp; The east
and west faces of this south portion of the transept are nearly
similar.&nbsp; The aisles have no parapet; the windows are
pointed, of four lights each, with late decorated tracery and
small intervening buttresses.&nbsp; The clerestory has a parapet
similar to that of the nave; the windows are pointed, large, and
lofty, with perpendicular tracery and two transoms.&nbsp; The
south front of this transept, flat at top, is flanked with square
embattled turrets and buttresses, and has a large window of the
perpendicular age, filling up nearly all the space between
them.&nbsp; The south face of the aisles, on each side, have
pointed windows and sloping tops, without parapet, but flanked by
double buttresses at the external angles, without pinnacles.</p>
<p>The south face of the choir, with its aisle, is in nearly all
respects similar to the south portion of the transept; but the
aisle is lengthened out beyond the choir, and becomes the side
aisle of the Lady Chapel, and has an octangular turret near the
east end, with embattled parapet, and beyond it a plain, heavy,
clumsy buttress; the sloping parapet of the east face of this
aisle meets at the top the flat plain parapet of the most eastern
compartment of the Lady Chapel, which projects beyond the aisle
to that extent.&nbsp; The windows of the Lady Chapel are all
pointed, and of good perpendicular character; the projecting
portion has double buttresses at the external angles, and the
eastern face has a low gable point.&nbsp; This chapel is very
little higher than the side aisles of the choir, the east face of
which is seen over it, with a large lofty pointed <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>window, with
perpendicular tracery and several transoms, flanked with
octagonal turrets engaged, and terminated with something like
domes of Elizabethan architecture.&nbsp; The parapet of this east
face of the choir is flat.&nbsp; The north side of the Lady
Chapel is similar to the south; the choir and its aisles exhibit
features of an early English character on this side, but the
Chapter-room, which is a small building, of an oblong form, and
also of early English architecture, conceals a considerable
portion.&nbsp; Over its vestibule and the arched passage leading
into the east walk of the cloister, is seen the large window in
the north front of the transept; the arch is much depressed, the
tracery very common and plain, and it has two transoms; the walls
of this wing of the transept are very plain, flat at top, and no
parapet.&nbsp; The whole north side of the nave can be seen only
from the cloister-yard.&nbsp; The south walk of the cloister is
gone, and in the wall of the aisle, below the windows, are still
seen several enriched semicircular arches resting on short
cylindrical columns, evidently belonging to the original church
of Hugh Lupus.&nbsp; The windows of the aisle are Tudor arched,
with the ordinary tracery of this period; but, owing to the
cloister once existing beneath, are necessarily curtailed of half
their due length: there is a thin, flat buttress between each;
the aisle has no parapet.&nbsp; The clerestory is lofty, and the
windows pointed, and not so much depressed as those in the aisle
beneath: they are not so lofty as those in the south side, nor
have they any canopies.&nbsp; There is a thin buttress between
each, without pinnacles, and the parapet is quite plain, but not
so shallow as that on the south side.</p>
<p>The central tower is perhaps the best external feature of this
Cathedral, it is indeed only of one story above the roof ridge,
but it is loftier than such towers usually are; in each face of
it are two pointed windows, divided down the middle with a single
mullion, with a quatrefoil at the top, and all of them having
flowing crocketted canopies with finials.&nbsp; At each of the
four angles of the tower is an octagonal turret engaged, all of
which, like the tower itself, are terminated with an embattled
parapet.</p>

<p>On entering the interior, through the west doorway into the
nave, &ldquo;some disappointment and regret,&rdquo; says the same
authority, &ldquo;cannot but be felt: here is no vaulted roof,
but a flat ceiling of wood, resting on brackets of the same
material, slightly arched, which gives the nave the appearance of
having less elevation than it really possesses; for the naves of
many much more magnificent cathedrals are not so lofty as this by
several feet, but by being <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>vaulted, their apparent height is
increased.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stone vaulting appears to have been
actually commenced, and was probably interrupted by the
dissolution: it is to be regretted that the work was not
completed, as it would have given to the nave a much more
imposing effect.&nbsp; The north wall of the nave, to the height
of the windows, is Norman work, and contains, on the side of the
cloisters, six tombs, where, as it appears from an old MS.
written on the back of an old charter, now in the British Museum,
the early Norman Abbots are interred.&nbsp; Under a wide arch
sunk in the south wall, which, from the ornaments attached to the
pillar near it, appears part of the original building, is a
coffin-shaped stone, with a cross fleury on the lid, over the
remains of some abbot.&nbsp; Nearly opposite to this is an altar
tomb, the sides of which are ornamented with Gothic niches, with
trefoil heads, and with quatrefoils set alternately, the
quatrefoils being also alternately filled with roses and
leopards&rsquo; heads; the lid slides, and discloses the lead
coffin, a part of which has been cut away; on the lid is a plain
coffin-shaped stone.&nbsp; It is highly probable that this tomb
contains the remains of one of the later abbots.</p>
<p>The pillars of the nave are clustered, and have rich bases and
foliated capitals, and the arches are pointed.&nbsp; In this part
of the Cathedral and the north transept are several monuments
worthy the attention of visitors.&nbsp; A pyramidical monument by
Nollekens, representing a female figure resting on a rock,
against which is placed a broken anchor; erected by Captain John
Matthews, R.N., to the memory of his wife.&nbsp; One, in white
marble, by Banks, representing the Genius of History weeping over
an urn, having three vols., inscribed &lsquo;Longinus,&rsquo;
&lsquo;Thucydides,&rsquo; &lsquo;Zenophon,&rsquo; placed by it;
erected to the memory of Dean Swift, the learned translator of
those works.&nbsp; One to the memory of Mrs. Barbara Dod, erected
by the minor canons.&nbsp; One to Captain John William Buchanan,
of the 16th Light Dragoons, slain at the battle of
Waterloo.&nbsp; One of Cavalier Sir William Mainwaring, killed at
Chester during the great civil war, 1644.&nbsp; Against the north
wall a handsome monument, enclosing a bust of Sir J. G. Egerton,
Bart., erected by subscriptions of the citizens of Chester, in
memory of their honourable and independent representative.&nbsp;
One in memory of Major Thomas Hilton, who died at Montmeir, in
the Burmese empire, 2nd February, 1829.&nbsp; One to Augusta, the
wife of the Rev. James Slade, Canon of the Cathedral, and
daughter of Bishop Law.&nbsp; One of Captain John Moor Napier,
who died of Asiatic cholera, in <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>Scinde, July 7th, 1846, aged 28
years: this monument was executed by Westmacott; the inscription
was written by his uncle, the gallant Sir Charles Napier, and is
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The tomb is no record of high lineage;<br
/>
His may be traced by his name.<br />
His race was one of soldiers:<br />
Among soldiers he lived, among them he died,<br />
A soldier, falling where numbers fell with him,<br />
In a barbarous land.<br />
Yet there died none more generous,<br />
More daring, more gifted, more religious.<br />
On his early grave<br />
Fell the tears of stern and hardy men,<br />
As his had fallen on the grave of others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the memory of their comrade, the officers of the
General Staff in Scinde erect this cenotaph.&rdquo;&mdash;[The
above was executed by Westmacott.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the north transept is a piece of very fine tapestry,
executed after one of the cartoons of Raphael, representing the
history of Elymas the sorcerer.&nbsp; Wright, in his travels
through France and Italy, expresses his opinion that this is much
superior to any of the tapestry which he saw in the
Vatican.&nbsp; There is also a well-executed stone monument to
Roger Barnston, Esq.; and a tablet in memory of good Chancellor
Peploe.&nbsp; A beautifully executed marble monument has lately
been placed on the wall of the north transept to the memory of
Colonel T. Graham Egerton, of the 77th Regiment, who fell at the
siege of Sebastopol, in April, 1855.</p>
<p>The choir well merits the attention of every visitor of
taste.&nbsp; From the organ-loft to the Bishop&rsquo;s throne,
the sides are ornamented with rich spiral tabernacle work,
underneath which are massive and highly ornamented stalls.&nbsp;
The choir is separated from the nave and broad aisle by a Gothic
stone screen; there are five pointed arches on each side; above
them is an arcade of pointed arches, resting on slender shafts,
and above it are the clerestory windows.&nbsp; The pavement of
the choir is of black and white marble.&nbsp; At the west end of
it are four stalls on each side of the entrance, and there are
twenty others on each side of the choir; over these are rich
canopies, with pinnacles and pendants in great profusion.&nbsp;
Above the stalls on the right hand, opposite the pulpit, is the
Bishop&rsquo;s throne, which formerly stood at the east end in
St. Mary&rsquo;s Chapel, and is said to have been the shrine of
<a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>St.
Werburgh, or, as suggested by Pennant, the pedestal on which
originally stood the real shrine which contained the sacred
relics.&nbsp; At the Reformation it was removed to its present
position, and converted into a throne for the Bishop.&nbsp; It is
a rich specimen of Gothic architecture, decorated with carved
work, and embellished with a range of thirty curious small
statues, variously habited, holding scrolls in their hands, and
originally inscribed with their names, but now defaced.&nbsp; Dr.
Cowper published, in 1799, an elaborate history of these figures,
and was of opinion that they represented kings and saints of the
royal Mercian line, ancestors or relations of St. Werburgh.&nbsp;
Very great improvements have recently been effected within the
choir.&nbsp; The restoration of the Bishop&rsquo;s throne was
effected by the munificence of the Rev. Canon Slade, as an
obituary testimonial to his late father-in-law, Bishop Law, in
memory of whom the following incription, engraven upon a brass
plate, is affixed to the throne:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>In gloriam Dei hanc cathedram reficiendam curabit
A.D. MDCCCXLVI.&nbsp; Jacobus Slade, A.M. hujus ecclesiae
Canonicus.&nbsp; Recnon in piam memoriam Georgii Henrici Law,
S.T.D. per xii. annos Episcopi Testriensis, dein
Bathoniensis.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the back of the throne is a magnificent stone screen, the
gift of the Archbishop of Canterbury.&nbsp; The altar screen was
presented by the Rev. Peploe Hamilton, of Hoole, near Chester;
the chair within the communion table by the Rev. Canon Blomfield;
the new Bible desk, of carved oak in the form of an eagle, by the
Rev. Chancellor Raikes; the new stone pulpit, from a beautiful
design by Mr. Hussey, was the liberal gift of Sir Edward S.
Walker, of Chester.&nbsp; Towards the restoration of the
Cathedral, Her Majesty the Queen also contributed a donation of
&pound;105, in the name of the Prince of Wales as Earl of
Chester.</p>
<p>Under the east window is an arch opening to the Lady Chapel,
which consists of a middle and two side aisles, the stone
vaulting of which is adorned with richly carved key-stones.&nbsp;
The side aisles are divided from the middle portion of two
arches, sprung from a massive pier on each side, apparently part
of the original building, cut down and crusted over with clusters
of light pillars, terminated in elegant pointed arches, with
quatrefoils inserted in the mouldings.&nbsp; On the north side of
the chancel, which extends beyond the side aisles, are two
elegant pointed arches: one contains two piscinas; the other was
apparently a seat for the officiating priest; another pointed
arch appears also on the opposite side.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>The
cloisters are on the north side of the Church, and form a
quadrangle of 110 feet square.&nbsp; Originally there were four
walks, but the south walk is destroyed.&nbsp; The general style
of the cloisters is that of the fifteenth century, with carved
cornice key-stones at the intersections of the vaulting; the
arches of the windows are depressed.&nbsp; A lavatory projects
from the west walk of the cloisters, and did extend along the
south walk; over the east walk was a dormitory, which was some
time ago destroyed, much to the injury of the appearance of these
venerable conventual ruins.&nbsp; It is obvious that the present
cloisters are only a restoration of an earlier one.&nbsp; In the
east walk of the cloisters is the entrance into the Chapter
House.&nbsp; The stone vaulting rests in clusters of slender
shafts, with foliated capitals; notwithstanding the soft nature
of the stone, the carving is all in a good state of
preservation.&nbsp; The Chapter House was built in the beginning
of the twelfth century, by Randle, Earl of Chester, who removed
hither, from the churchyard, the body of his uncle, Hugh Lupus,
whose remains were found enclosed in a stone coffin in 1723, by
persons employed in digging in the Chapter House.&nbsp; The skull
and bones were entire, and lay in their proper position,
enveloped in an ox-hide.&nbsp; On the breast was a piece of
cloth, the texture of which could not be ascertained.&nbsp; Mr.
Asphitel considers the Chapter House, with its singularly
tasteful vestibule, to be the finest in the kingdom.</p>
<p>We now direct the visitor&rsquo;s attention to a portion of
the Norman edifice, which has of late excited very great
interest, the Promptuarium, lately excavated: &ldquo;the chamber
is a sort of gallery or cloister on the ground floor, about
ninety feet long by forty feet wide, traversed in the centre by a
row of pillars (with one exception cylindrical), which divide it
into six double bays, from which pillars, and four corresponding
ones at each side, spring the intersecting arches by which the
building is vaulted.&nbsp; The side pillars are as entirely
Norman in their character as the centre ones, being simply the
square pier, on each face of which is the pilaster attached; the
groining of the roof is without the finish of ribs at the joints,
a finish characteristic of a later period.&nbsp; The chamber,
which has at present only a borrowed light from the cloisters on
the east, was originally lighted from the west side by a window
in each bay, except the second bay from the south end, in which
was a principal entrance.&nbsp; This doorway and the windows are
now all choked up by the adjoining garden.&nbsp; On the same
side, and at the north end, is a very large chimney and
fire-place.&nbsp; A glance at the groining <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>and arches at
the north end informing us that the chamber did formerly end
here, I was induced to think, by this situation of the
fire-place, that its length was originally very much
greater.&nbsp; I have since found the termination of the chamber
in the cellars of the present Registry, where the groining is
supported by corbels, which show that the vaults extended there,
but no further.&nbsp; One double bay, therefore, added to the
present remains, gives us the entire length of the
building&mdash;about 105 feet.&nbsp; In this last bay, on the
east side, is a principal doorway (four inches wider than the one
on the west side), leading towards the Refectory.&nbsp; On the
east side also, and near the north end, is a postern from the
cloisters and a spiral staircase, partly constructed in the
thickness of the wall, leading to the chamber above, of which
there are now no remains.&nbsp; Two small archways at opposite
sides of the chamber, precisely similar in form and size, and
rising from beneath the level of the floor, seemed to indicate a
subterranean passage connecting them.&nbsp; An excavation round
each has, however, discovered no channel between them.&nbsp; In
considering the character and situation of this vaulted chamber,
it should be borne in mind, that though now apparently
subterranean, it is only so with reference to the west side, the
level of the floor being four feet above the level of the nave of
the Cathedral.&nbsp; The ground, which now rises above it on the
west side, is all <i>made</i> ground of late date, belonging to
the Palace, the original level of which is identical with this
chamber, as shown by the area round the present Palace kitchens,
and by those apartments belonging to the Abbot&rsquo;s residence,
which yet remain.&rdquo; <a name="citation75"></a><a
href="#footnote75" class="citation">[75]</a></p>
<p>Mr. Asphitel, in his able lecture on Chester Cathedral,
bestowed the name of Promptuarium on this Norman cloister: he
says&mdash;&ldquo;These are vaulted apartments of early Norman
work, and are described in the charter of Henry Eighth, by which
he divides the properties between the Bishop and Dean,
<i>promptuaria et pannaria</i>, the former derived from a word
denoting a butler or steward, probably a buttery; and the latter,
from <i>pannus</i>, a cloth, probably the place for
clothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Ayrton, in an able paper on the Norman remains of the
Cathedral, read before the Chester Arch&aelig;ological
Association, entered into an elaborate inquiry on the subject,
stating his reasons for concluding that this is not a
<i>Promptuarium</i>, but, in his opinion, a spacious Hall, where
the splendid hospitality of the Abbots was displayed to
strangers, friends, and dependents.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>There
is a vaulted passage at the south end of the <i>Promptuarium</i>,
leading from the Abbot&rsquo;s apartments to the Cathedral: the
arches are circular, the groining is ribbed with elliptical
mouldings; these mouldings stamp a semi-Norman character on the
work, being almost a transition to the early English style.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Two beautiful Norman doorways gave ingress
and egress from the passage, and still remain, though the one
which opened to the present west cloister is closed, and sadly
disfigured by the alterations of the sixteenth century.&nbsp; The
other doorway, to the west, is yet perfect, excepting the shafts
of the pillars, which are gone.&nbsp; At the south end of the
east cloister, and forming the present entrance from that
cloister to the Cathedral, is a Norman doorway of about the same
date as the arcade adjoining it.&nbsp; The architrave is very
ornate, bearing the billet ornaments, accompanied by a bead which
runs between the mouldings; the capitals of the pilasters are
foliated, and identical with those already noticed in the Norman
doorway of the vaulted passage.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dimensions of the Cathedral are as follows:&mdash;Length
from east to west, 350 feet; nave, 160; choir, 125; Lady Chapel,
65; transept from north to south, 180; breadth of nave, choir,
and aisles, 74&frac12; feet; south wing of transept, 80 feet
square; height of nave and choir, 78 feet; tower, 127; Lady
Chapel, 33; north wing of transept, 39 feet broad.</p>

<p>Through the indefatigable energy of Dr. Anson, the present
Dean, many most important improvements have been introduced into
the interior of this noble edifice, which have added very much <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>to its
decoration and general effect.&nbsp; In 1843, the munificent sum
of &pound;4,000 was contributed for the purpose of giving effect
to the praiseworthy object of restoring some portion of the
ancient beauties of the Cathedral.&nbsp; A new organ has been
erected, of great power and richness of tone, the top of which is
carved with tabernacle work, in unison with that of the
choir.&nbsp; The old pews, which were sadly out of keeping with
the rich Gothic woodwork of the stalls, have been removed, and
the choir has been new seated in the Gothic style.</p>
<p>The whole of the choir has been vaulted, which has greatly
contributed to its improved appearance.&nbsp; A great number of
beautiful stained-glass windows, principally the gifts of private
families as obituary memorials, have been introduced since the
commencement of the improvements in 1843.&nbsp; The large window
of stained glass, at the west end, was presented by Mrs.
Hamilton, of Hoole, by whose liberality a splendid restoration of
the Lady Chapel has been effected.</p>
<p>The interior of the Cathedral excites a general feeling of
admiration, which the exterior fails to realize.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Church of St.
Oswald&rsquo;s</span>,</h3>
<p>as already mentioned, forms the south transept of the choir of
Chester Cathedral.&nbsp; After the introduction of regular monks
into the monastery of St. Werburgh, anciently dedicated to the
Holy Trinity and St. Oswald, the name of this patron saint was
retained by that part of the conventual church which was set
apart for the uses of the inhabitants of the parish, within which
the monastery was placed.&nbsp; This part probably occupied the
site of that transept of the Cathedral which forms the present
parish church.&nbsp; The name of St. Oswald does not, however,
appear to have been originally used for the parish.&nbsp; In the
licence of appropriation by William Cornhall, Bishop of Coventry,
it is called the parish church of St. Werburgh.</p>
<p>It appears to have been subsequently called the Church of St.
Oswald and the Church of St. Werburgh indiscriminately.&nbsp; It
was founded in the ninth century by Ethelfleda, Countess of
Mercia.&nbsp; So early as 1093, when Earl Leofric introduced
regular monks into the Cathedral, that part of it now occupied by
St. Oswald&rsquo;s was set apart for the use of the parishioners,
as we have just stated.&nbsp; The abbot and convent afterwards
wishing to re-attach it to the Cathedral, built for the
parishioners a small chapel, dedicated <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>to St. Nicholas, in the spot where
the Music Hall now stands; but they do not appear to have been
contented with their new place of worship; for in 1488 we find,
from Gastrel&rsquo;s &lsquo;Notitia,&rsquo; that a
&ldquo;composition was made between the Abbot and the
parishioners of St. Oswald&rsquo;s for their new
church.&rdquo;&nbsp; They accordingly re-entered into the south
transept, which had been rebuilt by Abbot Ripley, and have ever
since used it as their parish church.</p>
<p>St. Oswald&rsquo;s was formerly in a state of great
dilapidation; and was only separated from the aisle of the
Cathedral by a slight wooden screen.&nbsp; In 1827 it was
thoroughly repaired; the whole was new flagged and pewed, a new
pulpit and reading desk added; the old gallery, which was at the
west side, taken down, and a new one erected at the south
end.&nbsp; The interior was cut off from the aisle by a
partition, erected by Dr. Coplestone when Dean, who expended more
than &pound;1,000 in various improvements.</p>
<p>St. Oswald&rsquo;s is a vicarage, in the gift of the Dean and
Chapter of Chester Cathedral.&nbsp; The present vicar is the Rev.
William Harrison, M.A.</p>

</a></p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Church of St. John the
Baptist</span>.</h3>
<p>The church is situated without the city walls, a short
distance from the Newgate; it stands upon an elevation
overhanging the north bank of the Dee, and the churchyard
commands a beautiful and extensive prospect.</p>
<p>This church, with its adjoining ruins, is the most interesting
of the ecclesiastical buildings of Chester.</p>
<p>The foundation of the church is ascribed by Webb to Ethelred,
Ring of Mercia, and stated, on the authority of Giraldus, to have
taken place in the year 689.&nbsp; The MS. chronicle of St.
Werburgh makes a similar statement on the same authority; it is
also adopted by the author of &lsquo;Polycronicon,&rsquo; and
thus quaintly recorded&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The year of grace six hundred fourscore
nine,<br />
So saith my author, a Briton, Giraldus,<br />
King Etheldred, minding most the bliss of heaven,<br />
Edified a college church, notable and famous,<br />
In the suburbs of Chester, pleasant and beauteous,<br />
In the honour of God, and the Baptist St. John,<br />
With the help of Bishop Wulfrice, and good
exhortation.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This inscription is now affixed to a pillar on the north side
of the church.&nbsp; With respect to its foundation by Ethelred,
we find the following curious passage, quoted from an early
writer by King <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>and others:&mdash;&ldquo;King Ethelred minding to build
a church, was told that where he should see a white hind there he
should build a church; which white hind he saw in the place where
St. John&rsquo;s Church now standeth, and in remembrance whereof,
his picture was placed in the wall of the said church, which yet
standeth on the side of the steeple, towards the west, having a
white hind in his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to William of Malmsbury, St. John&rsquo;s was
repaired and richly endowed by Leofric, Earl of Mercia, in 1057,
and it is shortly afterwards thus noticed in Doomsday
Book:&mdash;&ldquo;Ecclesia Sancti Johanius, in civitate
hab&eacute;t viii. domos, quietas ab omn&eacute; consuetudine:
una ex his est matricularii ecclesi&aelig;; ali&aelig; sunt
canonicorum.&rdquo;&nbsp; The seat of the See, which for some
centuries after the conquest fluctuated between Chester,
Coventry, and Lichfield, was, in 1075, fixed for a time in the
Church of St. John, by Peter, then Bishop, which may be taken as
a sufficient proof of the wealth and grandeur of the foundation,
even at this early period.&nbsp; The succeeding Bishop, Robert de
Limesey, having removed the seat of the See to Coventry, St.
John&rsquo;s returned to its former collegiate establishment, but
was long afterwards considered and denominated one of the three
Cathedrals of the diocese, and retained in its immediate
neighbourhood a palace of the Bishop, and the mansion of the
Archdeacon of Chester&mdash;the remains of its former
importance.&nbsp; At the dissolution in 1547, the college
consisted of one dean, seven prebends, four vicars, a clerk, and
a sexton.&nbsp; &ldquo;In this church,&rdquo; says Dr. Cowper,
&ldquo;was an ancient rood, or image of wood, of such veneration,
that in a deed dated March 27, 1311, confirmed by Walter Langton,
the church was called the <i>Church of the Holy Cross and St.
John</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There can be little doubt, on the
whole,&rdquo; says Ormerod, &ldquo;that some monastic foundation,
dedicated to the Holy Cross, had, previously to this, merged in
the college of St. John.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1468 the old steeple,
which stood between the nave and the chancel, fell in, and
destroyed great part of the choir.&nbsp; In 1470 the steeple was
rebuilt, and the whole church covered with lead at the expense of
the parishioners, to whom certain immunities were granted by the
Dean on that account.&nbsp; In 1548, a commission was granted to
certain gentlemen of Cheshire to survey the colleges, &amp;c.,
within the county; in virtue whereof a return (now in the
Augmentation Office) was made, wherein the annual rent of the
college of St. John, arising from lands, tithes, &amp;c., is
reckoned at &pound;146 5s.&nbsp; The church plate <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>is estimated
in the same return at 465 ounces; the weight of the five bells,
4,000 lbs.; lead in and upon the church, 78 tons; and goods and
ornaments for the use of the clergy to the value of &pound;40
19s. 9d.&nbsp; In 1572, the greater part of the central steeple
again fell in; and in 1574, part of the steeple at the west end
of the church also gave way, whereby great part of the church was
destroyed.&nbsp; After being suffered to remain in a ruinous
state for some years, the parishioners obtained a grant of the
church from Queen Elizabeth in 1581, whereupon they repaired and
reduced it to its present size and form, by taking down the
remains of the central steeple, and cutting off the south and
north transepts and all the chapels above the choir.&nbsp; In
1585, the Queen granted the impropriate rectory and advowson to
Sir Christopher Halton, by whom it was conveyed to Alexander
King, who, in 1587, conveyed it to Alexander Cotes, whose
daughter brought it by marriage to the family of the Sparkes, in
1597; in which family it continued until the year 1810, when it
was sold by their representative, John Adams, Esq., to the late
Marquis of Westminster, who, in 1813, rebuilt the north and south
transepts, and repaired the chancel, in which he introduced a
Gothic window over the altar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;St. Johns, when entire,&rdquo; says Pennant, &ldquo;was
a magnificent pile.&nbsp; The tower once stood in the centre, but
falling down in 1574, was never rebuilt.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;The
church,&rdquo; says Ormerod, &ldquo;was in the finest style of
early Norman architecture; it consisted originally of a nave and
choir, with side aisles, two transepts, and a central tower,
&amp;c.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On each side of the chancel were added, at a later period,
chapels in a rich style of pointed Gothic, in which some
exquisite specimens of shrine work are yet remaining.</p>
<p>The nave and choir, fitted up and repaired in 1581, as before
mentioned, now form the parish church, in which public worship is
celebrated.&nbsp; Eight arches, resting on pillars 5 feet 6
inches in circumference, with capitals variously ornamented,
separate the nave from the side aisles; and above these are two
rows of galleries, with pointed arches, springing from light
shafts.&nbsp; Four massive composite pillars, which formerly
supported the central tower, still remain in the nave.&nbsp; In
the interior are some interesting relics of the architecture of
our Norman ancestors.</p>
<p>The belfry is detached from the church, at the north-west
corner of which it is situate.&nbsp; It is a square tower,
erected in the seventeenth century, 150 feet in height.&nbsp; It
is extremely lofty, and its <a name="page82"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 82</span>sides are decorated with pointed
windows in a good style, figures placed in rich shrines, strings
of quatrefoils and rows of ornamental arches; in one of the
niches on the west side is placed a statue which has excited much
controversy.&nbsp; It is much defaced by time and exposure to the
weather.</p>
<p>At the east end of the church, as now rebuilt, stand the ruins
of the chapels above the choir, consisting of the outer walls,
with the remains of several windows of Gothic architecture; and
the eastern wall, containing a beautiful arched window, of the
same style, but larger and richer in ornament than the
others.</p>
<p>Near the foot of the tower, on the north side of the church,
is an ancient porch, forming the principal entrance, in the sides
of which are two lancet arches, the entrance being under an
acutely pointed arch, the mouldings of which rest on a number of
short shafts, which converge as they retire inwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within this church,&rdquo; says Ormerod, &ldquo;was a
chantry, dedicated to St. Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Within the precincts
of St. John&rsquo;s were also Thorneton&rsquo;s chantry, the
Chapel of St. Anne, which Piggott says, &ldquo;in some deeds, is
called the &lsquo;<i>Monastery</i> of St. Anne;&rsquo; was
endowed with land and houses, some of which now constitute the
revenues of Northwich school:&rdquo; there was also the Chapel of
St. James&rsquo;s, which Lysons says was the old parish church;
in 1662 it is described as being then used as a stable.&nbsp; It
has long since been entirely destroyed.&nbsp; On the south wall
of the churchyard was an ancient building, called the
&ldquo;Anchorite&rsquo;s Cell,&rdquo; which is said to be the
spot where Earl Harold retired after the battle of Hastings, in
1066; a monkish chronicle being extant, which denies the fact of
his death in that fight, and states that he lived for some time
after at Chester, in the disguise of a monk.&nbsp; In 1770 two
skeletons were discovered here in coffin-shaped cavities, scooped
out of the rock.&nbsp; The fourteen panel tables which are hung
in various parts of the church, bearing the arms of the deceased
to whose memory they are placed, are said to be painted by one of
the Randle Holmes, the distinguished herald artists.&nbsp; This
noble church is horridly disfigured by huge galleries and
unsightly pews, for the removal of which an effort is now making,
as a prelude to a general restoration of the sacred
edifice.&nbsp; The present vicar is the Rev. W. B. Marsden,
M.A.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">St. Peter&rsquo;s Church</span>.</h3>
<p>This church stands exactly in the centre of the city, where
the four principal streets meet, and close to the ancient site of
the <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>high
cross.&nbsp; It consists of a nave and side aisles, divided from
each other by three pointed arches.&nbsp; &ldquo;The span of the
arches, and the height of the building,&rdquo; says Ormerod,
&ldquo;are very disproportionate to the present size of the
interior, and give it the appearance of being a fragment of a
much larger building.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a square tower on the
south-west side are eight bells, cast in 1709, whereof six are a
peal; on the treble is engraved, &ldquo;When you ring, I&rsquo;ll
sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pennant is of opinion, as we have before stated, that on this
site formerly stood the Roman Pr&aelig;torium.&nbsp; Tradition
says that this church was built by Ethelfleda, Countess of
Mercia, and that it was originally dedicated to St. Peter and St.
Paul, at the time when the name of the &ldquo;mother
church&rdquo; was changed to the Holy Trinity and St.
Oswald.&nbsp; Bradshaw, the Monk, alluding thereto,
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And the old church of St. Peter and
Paul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By a general consent of the spirituality,<br />
With the help of the Duke most principal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was translated into the midst of the said
city.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Domesday it is noticed under its present name,
&ldquo;Templum Sancti Petri.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1081 it was given by
Robert de Rodeland to the Monks of St. Ebrulf, in Normandy, by
whom it was shortly afterwards resigned to the Abbot of St.
Werburgh.&nbsp; In 1479 the steeple was rebuilt, on which
occasion the parson, and other inhabitants, ate a goose at the
top of it, and flung the bones into the four principal streets
beneath.&nbsp; In 1580 eight yards of the spire of the steeple
were new built.&nbsp; A.D. 1637&ndash;40, the east end of the
church, and the south side from the window stools, was
re-edificed, the roof almost new leaded, most of the pews new
made, all the rest repaired, and all the aisles nagged.&nbsp; At
the dissolution, the patronage of St. Peter was vested in the
Dean and Chapter of Chester; it afterwards reverted to the Crown,
but is now solely in the gift of the Bishop.&nbsp; The spire of
this church, having been injured by lightning, was taken down in
1780, and in 1787 the south side of the church was recased with
stone.&nbsp; The steeple was rebuilt, and a new clock was placed
in it, in 1813; other improvements in the interior have been
subsequently made with good taste and effect.&nbsp; The Rev. John
Watson is the rector.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">The Church of the Holy
Trinity</span></h3>
<p>is situated on the north side of Watergate-street, adjoining
the Custom House.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>All
traces of the foundation and endowment of this church are buried
in remote antiquity.&nbsp; The earliest evidence of its
existence, now to be found, is in a charter relative to the
church of Rostherne, in the twelfth century, amongst the
witnesses to which is &ldquo;Walterus Ecclesi&aelig; Sanct&aelig;
Trinitatis Presbyterus.&rdquo;&nbsp; The advowson was anciently
vested in the Barons of Montalt, now called Hawarden, with which
barony it passed to the Crown, by whom it was given to the Earls
of Salisbury, from whom it passed to the Stanleys of Lathom,
whose representative, the Earl of Derby, is the present
patron.&nbsp; In 1401, Henry, Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester
(afterwards Henry the Fifth), confirmed to the citizens of
Chester a charter, whereby they were relieved from payment of
tithes for the Roodeye to the parson of Trinity parish.&nbsp; In
1679, the south and east sides of this church, being in a ruinous
state, were rebuilt.&nbsp; The tower was formerly surmounted by a
remarkably light and elegant spire, 159 feet in height.&nbsp;
This, however, from the perishable nature of its materials and
its exposed situation, required very frequent repairs, and about
seventy-five years ago the upper part was so frequently and
severely injured by storms, as to require rebuilding thrice in
eight years.&nbsp; In 1811 the whole structure of the spire was
in such a state of decay, that reasonable doubts were entertained
of its safety, if allowed to remain; it was therefore taken down,
and the tower reduced to its present altitude.&nbsp; The burying
ground adjoining this church having been found inadequate to the
increased population of the parish, a piece of ground, to the
eastward of the city gaol, was purchased in 1809, and converted
to that purpose, at an expense of &pound;1,000.</p>
<p>The interior of this church consists of a nave, chancel, and
side aisles, divided from the nave by three pointed arches on the
south side; but on the north the arches have been removed, and
their places supplied by iron pillars.&nbsp; A thorough repair
took place in 1826, when a number of free sittings were erected
in the galleries.</p>
<p>Dr. Parnell, Archdeacon of Clogher, whose poems are familiar
to every person of taste and feeling, was buried in this church,
October 24th, 1718, having died at Chester, on his way to
Ireland.</p>
<p>There are several monuments worthy of attention.&nbsp; Within
the communion rails lie the remains of Matthew Henry, the
celebrated commentator, who officiated in the Presbyterian chapel
in Cook-street; there is a Latin inscription to his memory on a
brass plate.&nbsp; The Rev. F. Ayckbown, M.A., is the rector.</p>
<h3><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span><span
class="smcap">St. Martin&rsquo;s Church</span>,</h3>
<p>formerly called <i>St. Martins of the Ash</i>, stands at the
west end of White Friars and Cuppin-street.&nbsp; It appears to
have been an ancient foundation; for it is mentioned in a deed,
in the year 1250, wherein Bernard de Trannuille releases to
Philip le Clerk a rent of 12d. arising from premises situate
&ldquo;near the Church of St. Martin in Chester.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
old church mentioned in this deed, having fallen into decay, was
rebuilt in 1721, as we learn from an inscription on the front of
the steeple.&nbsp; The open ground in front of this church bears
the name of <i>Martin&rsquo;s Ash</i>, derived in all likelihood
from the circumstance of an ash tree having formerly stood on the
spot.&nbsp; The parish is now united to that of St. Bridget, and
the service in St. Martin&rsquo;s is discontinued.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s Church</span>,</h3>
<p>anciently called <i>Ecclesia Sanct&aelig; Mari&aelig; de
Castello</i> and <i>Ecclesia Sanct&aelig; Mari&aelig; super
Montem</i>, but now <i>St. Mary&rsquo;s on the Hill</i>, stands
at the upper end of Castle-street, at the extreme verge of the
liberties of the city.</p>
<p>Although the precise date of the foundation of this church
cannot be ascertained, yet it is not improbable that it was one
of those founded early in the twelfth century by Lucy, sister of
Edwin, Earl of Mercia, and widow of Randle de Meschines, Earl of
Chester, a lady remarkable as a benefactress to the &ldquo;holy
church,&rdquo; even in that church-erecting and endowing
age.&nbsp; At all events, St. Mary&rsquo;s was gifted to the
Abbey of St. Werburgh, by Randle Gernons, Earl of Chester, son of
the above-named lady, in one of those fits of compunction which
usually followed the acts of violence into which his turbulence
and ambition frequently led him.&nbsp; Shortly after the
dissolution, the Dean and Chapter of St. Werburgh obtained a
grant from the Crown of the rectory of St. Mary&rsquo;s, which
was surrendered by Dean Cliffe in 1550, to Sir R. Cotton, by
whose agent it was sold for &pound;100 to John Brereton, Esq., of
Wettenhall, by whose heirs it was again sold to the Wilbrahams of
Dorfold, from whom it passed by marriage to the Hills of Hough,
in Wybunbury, from whom it was purchased by the late Marquis of
Westminster.</p>
<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s consists of a nave, chancel, and side aisles,
with a square tower at the west end, used as a belfry.&nbsp; The
south aisle, called <i>Troutbeck&rsquo;s Chapel</i>, was erected
by William Troutbeck, of Dunham, in the fifteenth century.&nbsp;
This chapel is noticed in the <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>ecclesiastical survey taken by the
Commissioners appointed by Henry the Eighth, and its annual
rents, arising from lands and tenements within the city of
Chester, are estimated at &pound;5 6s.&nbsp; In this chapel were
many monuments of the founder&rsquo;s family, which, according to
Holmes, &ldquo;were thought to exceed anything of the kind in
England;&rdquo; but these were destroyed, by the falling in of
the roof, in 1660.&nbsp; In 1690, the parishioners having
obtained a grant of the site from the Duke of Shrewsbury,
representative of the Troutbecks, built thereon the present south
aisle.&nbsp; The north aisle was anciently called the <i>Chapel
of St. Catherine</i>.</p>
<p>The tower of St. Mary&rsquo;s is only 50 feet high, its
further elevation having been objected to by the Governor of
Chester Castle, when it was repaired in 1715, lest it should
command the castle-yard.</p>
<p>In this church are several monuments well worthy the attention
of the visitor.&nbsp; Amongst these is one to the memory of
Thomas Gamul, Recorder of Chester, who died in 1613.&nbsp; The
deceased is represented in a recumbent posture, with his wife on
his right hand, and his only son in the attitude of prayer at his
knee: on the side of the tomb his three daughters, who died in
infancy, holding skeletons in their hands.&nbsp; The statues of
this monument are of alabaster.&nbsp; Another to the memory of
Philip Oldfield, of Bradwell, who died in 1616, represents him in
the costume of that age, leaning on his right side, with a roll
of parchment in his hand.&nbsp; The slab is supported by kneeling
figures of his four sons, with their hands upon their sword
hilts: at the head are figures of his two daughters bearing
shields.&nbsp; In the north aisle are tablets to the memory of
different members of the family of Holmes, the celebrated
antiquaries.&nbsp; Of this family, four successively bore the
name of Randle.&nbsp; The first, who was Sheriff of Chester in
1615, and Mayor in 1633, died in 1654; the second was Mayor of
Chester in 1643, and died in 1659; the third, author of the
&lsquo;Academic Armoury,&rsquo; was gentleman sewer to Charles
the Second, and Deputy Garter King of Arms, and died in 1699; and
the fourth was Deputy Norroy King of Arms, and died in
1707.&nbsp; Of these four Randle Holmes, the second and third
were the celebrated antiquarian collectors; and there are some
compilations of a similar nature, brought down to 1704, by the
last.&nbsp; Several stained-glass windows have lately been
introduced, the principal ones consisting of a memorial in honour
of the heroes of the 23rd regiment of Welsh Fusiliers, who fell
at the battle of the Alma in the Russian war: and another to the
memory of the late rector, the Rev. W. H. <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Massie, who
was universally beloved, and who effected great improvements in
the church and parish.</p>
<p>St. Mary&rsquo;s is a rectory, in the gift of the Marquis of
Westminster.&nbsp; The present rector is the Rev. C. Boween,
M.A.</p>
<p>There are Sunday evening lectures in this church, under the
patronage of the Bishop of the diocese.&nbsp; They are supported
by annual subscriptions, aided by collections in the church.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">St. Bridget&rsquo;s Church</span>.</h3>
<p>The old church of St. Bridget, or St. Bride (now removed), was
situate on the west side of Bridge-street, exactly opposite to
St. Michael&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There exists no correct data on which
to ascertain the time of its foundation, which tradition
attributes to Offa, King of Mercia, who reigned in the end of the
eighth century, about which time we are told that several
churches were founded in Chester.&nbsp; There is, however, clear
evidence, from writings among the Harleian MSS., that in the
twelfth century the patronage of this church belonged to the
Lords of Aldford, by one of whom, in 1224, it was quitclaimed to
Randle Blundeville.&nbsp; From another writing it appears that,
in 1265, Simon, Abbot of St. Werburgh, in consideration of
certain grants and donations, made to him by Bertram de Arneway,
bound himself to maintain a chaplain to say mass for the soul of
John Arneway, before the altar of the Virgin in St.
Bridget&rsquo;s Church.&nbsp; This church was formerly surrounded
by a wall, which encroached considerably upon Bridge-street, and
the ground between this wall and the church was used as a
burying-place; but in 1785 the bodies were removed to a piece of
ground on the south of the church, and the street widened.&nbsp;
The church walls were refaced with freestone, and other repairs
made at the same time.&nbsp; A gateway formerly crossed the
street between St. Bridget&rsquo;s and St. Michael&rsquo;s
churches, dividing higher from lower Bridge-street.&nbsp; The old
church of St. Bridget was taken down in 1827, under the
provisions of the New Bridge Act, in order to improve the
approach into the city, and the new church was erected on the
north-west side of the castle.&nbsp; The ceremony of laying the
foundation stone was performed by the Right Rev. C. J. Blomfield,
then Lord Bishop of the diocese.&nbsp; The length is about 90
feet, and the width 50, and the church is calculated to contain
1,000 persons.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is rather a remarkable
circumstance,&rdquo; says Hemingway, &ldquo;that although St.
Bridget&rsquo;s parish is wholly within the city, the ground
occupied by the church and cemetery is neither within the parish
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>nor the
city, but altogether within the county palatine; but by a clause
in the act, it is enacted, that after the consecration, it shall
&lsquo;for all purposes, and to all intents whatsoever, be deemed
part of, and situated within the said parish of St. Bridget, and
within the said city of Chester.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. G. Salt, M.A., is the present incumbent.</p>

<p>is situate on the east side of Bridge-street, opposite the end
of Grosvenor-street, leading to the New Bridge.&nbsp; The time of
its foundation is uncertain, but it is supposed to have been
connected with the Monastery of St. Michael, which was given to
the priory of Norton by Roger de Lacy in a charter, subsequently
confirmed by Henry the Second; it is recorded by Bradshaw, that
&ldquo;the Monastery of St. Michael was burnt by the great fire
which happened on Mid-Lent Sunday in 1118, at eight of the clock
(all being in church), and consumed the greatest part of the
city.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is conjectured that this monastery was
situated in Bridge-street, in Rock&rsquo;s-court, where, Dr.
Williamson says, &ldquo;before it was converted into dwelling
houses, one might have beheld fair, churchlike windows, and other
demonstrations of its being part of a religious
house.&rdquo;&nbsp; The chancel was rebuilt in 1496, and enlarged
in 1678.&nbsp; The old steeple, which was built in 1710, having
fallen into decay, from the perishable nature of the red
sandstone, was taken down in 1849, and the present handsome
structure, built with white stone, was erected in its
place.&nbsp; The south, east, and a portion of the north walls of
the church having also been found to be in a very defective
state, they were taken down in 1850; in fact, the church has been
almost entirely rebuilt, as none of the old walls remain, except
the three internal arches, and a part of the north wall.&nbsp;
The flat ceiling has been removed, but the nave and chancel roofs
being principally constructed of oak, and in a good state of
preservation, have been retained; they have, however, been
re-slated.&nbsp; The north chancel has been entirely rebuilt and
new roofed.&nbsp; The north aisle of the nave is divided from the
body of the church by three pointed arches springing from
octagonal columns, the capitals being ornamented with
quatrefoils.&nbsp; The interior of the old building was very
inconvenient, unsightly, and dilapidated, but it is now
completely restored in proper ecclesiastical style.&nbsp; The
chancel is paved with beautiful tiles, those within the communion
rails being liberally given by Mr. Minton.&nbsp; <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Each
compartment of the five chancel windows is surrounded with a neat
border of stained glass.&nbsp; The style of architecture adopted
in the restoration of the church is the transition from the
decorated to the perpendicular, that being considered as best
suited to those portions of the old building which are
retained.&nbsp; Great credit is due to Mr. James Harrison, the
architect, for the very great skill and judgment he has displayed
in the restoration of the church.&nbsp; The total cost was about
&pound;1,700, of which the parishioners borrowed &pound;500 on
the security of the church rates; the remaining sum was raised by
subscription.&nbsp; Besides many smaller bequests from different
individuals, this parish enjoys, under the will of Dr. Robert
Oldfield, dated 24th of April, 1695, &ldquo;two-thirds of Dunham
Hall, and other lands and messuages at Dunham-on-the-Hill,
together with lands at Boughton, for the purpose of paying
&pound;20 a year to the minister, provided he hold no other
preferment, and of binding poor boys apprentices born in that
parish, and of maintaining one or more poor boys, who should be
apt to learn, at the University.&rdquo;&nbsp; Owing to proper
objects not having every year presented themselves, the revenues
have accumulated, and with the bequeathed property now produce an
annual rent of upwards of &pound;400.&nbsp; St. Michael&rsquo;s
is a perpetual curacy, in the gift of the Bishop of
Chester.&nbsp; The present officiating minister is the Rev. J. F.
Hewson.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Christ Church</span></h3>
<p>is situated in a thickly inhabited district called Newtown;
the rapid increase in the population of this locality rendering
additional church accommodation necessary, the present edifice
was erected to supply the need.&nbsp; It was consecrated on
October 23, 1838.&nbsp; The cost was &pound;3,390 (including
&pound;1,000 for endowment, &pound;100 for repair fund,
&amp;c.)&nbsp; The Rev. W. Gibson, formerly rector of St.
Bride&rsquo;s, Chester, and now rector of Fawley, Hampshire, gave
&pound;1,425; the then Bishop of Chester (Dr. Sumner), the Rev.
Chancellor Raikes, and Miss Rowe, &pound;100 each; H. Raikes,
Esq., &pound;55; the late General Beckwith, &pound;50; W.
Wardell, Esq., &pound;50; the Diocesan Church Building Society,
&pound;500.&nbsp; The church is built in the early English style
of architecture.&nbsp; The Rev. R. D. Thomas is the present
incumbent.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">St. Paul&rsquo;s Church</span>,</h3>
<p>the most unsightly church in England probably, is situated
near to Barrel Well, Boughton, and was built by public
subscription, <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>under the patronage of Bishop Blomfield and Bishop
Sumner.&nbsp; It was erected in 1830, at the cost of about
&pound;2,000.&nbsp; It is capable of seating about 800 persons;
400 free sittings being appropriated for the poor.&nbsp; There is
no endowment for the church, the income of the minister being
derived from the pew rents.&nbsp; The present incumbent is the
Rev. J. Gaman, M.A.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">St. Olave&rsquo;s Church</span></h3>
<p>is situated on the east side of Lower Bridge-street, opposite
Castle-street.&nbsp; It is a small, oblong structure, in outward
appearance much resembling a barn.&nbsp; This church is of great
antiquity, having been erected before the Norman Conquest.&nbsp;
In the eleventh century it was possessed by the Botelars, by whom
it was given, with two houses in the Market-place, to the Abbey
of St. Werburgh, in 1101.</p>
<p>After the great civil war, St. Olave&rsquo;s fell into disuse
as a place of public worship, being only employed for baptisms
and burials, on which occasions the minister of St.
Michael&rsquo;s officiated.&nbsp; It was, however, re-opened as a
parish church about the middle of last century, and continued so
until the year 1841, when service in the church was discontinued,
and the parish united with that of St. Michael&rsquo;s.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Little St. John&rsquo;s</span>.</h3>
<p>We refer the reader to the notice we have already given of
this ancient hospital and chapel in a former page.&nbsp; The
present incumbent is the Rev. William Clarke, B.D.</p>
<h3>DISSENTING PLACES OF WORSHIP.</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Unitarian Chapel</span></h4>
<p>claims priority of notice, as being the first dissenting place
of worship in Chester.&nbsp; The following succinct sketch of the
history of this building is taken from Pigott&rsquo;s
&lsquo;History of Chester:&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Unitarian chapel is a large brick
building, with a burial ground in front, situated between
Crook-lane and Trinity-lane, having an entrance from each of
those streets, and is generally called Crook&rsquo;s-lane
Chapel.&nbsp; It was built in 1700 by a large, flourishing,
respectable society, which had been formed in 1687 by the
celebrated Matthew Henry, son of the learned, pious, and
laborious Philip Henry, one of the ejected ministers.&nbsp; In
the register book belonging <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>to the congregation of this place
there is a short account of the rise, progress, and transactions
of the society, written by Mr. Henry in 1710, being the
twenty-third year of his ministry.&nbsp; From this account, it
appears that in 1682 there were three dissenting congregations in
Chester, which had been founded by Mr. William Cook, Mr. Ralph
Hall, and Mr. John Harvey, ministers of the Established Church,
who had been ejected from their respective livings on account of
their non-compliance with the Act of Uniformity.&nbsp; After the
death of Mr. Cook and Mr. Hall, their congregations were entirely
broken up and dispersed by the persecutions of the times; but
such of them as continued dissenters occasionally held meetings
at each other&rsquo;s houses, or joined Mr. Harvey&rsquo;s
congregation, which assembled at his house in a private manner,
in order to avoid the penalties which were then in force against
the Nonconformists.&nbsp; James the Second, under the pretence of
universal toleration, but with a view to the establishment of
popery, granted them the liberty of public worship, of which they
had been deprived in the latter part of the reign of Charles the
Second.&nbsp; It was at this time that Mr. Henry, who began his
ministry in Chester, collected the remains of the congregation of
Mr. Cook and Mr. Hall, and opened a meeting in White
Friars&rsquo;-lane.&nbsp; Mr. Harvey, who had been ejected from
Wallasey, in Cheshire, continued to preside over a dissenting
congregation in Bridge-street for thirteen years after toleration
was granted; he died November, 1699; he was succeeded by his son,
who resigned in 1706, on account of ill-health.&nbsp; His
congregation, which was large and opulent, was united to that of
Mr. Henry, and in 1707 a large gallery was built on the south
side of Crook&rsquo;s-lane meeting-house for their better
accommodation.&nbsp; Thus the three original nonconformist
societies were united in one, under the pastoral care of Mr.
Henry, who was then the only dissenting minister in
Chester.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Henry removed from Chester to Hackney in 1713, and died of
apoplexy, at Nantwich, where he had been on a visit to his
friends, in June, 1714, in the 52nd year of his age, and was
buried in Trinity Church in this city.&nbsp; His exposition of
the Bible has gone through very many editions, and is still in
great repute.&nbsp; Mr. John Gardiner succeeded Mr. Henry in
1713, and held his appointment for more than half a
century.&nbsp; During the latter years of his ministry, his
religious opinions appear to have undergone a decided change,
departing very much from the doctrines maintained by Mr. Henry,
which gradually prepared the way for <a name="page92"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 92</span>the full development of Unitarianism
in the place by his successor, Mr. Chidlaw, who was an avowed
believer and advocate of the tenets peculiar to that system of
Socinian doctrine.&nbsp; The present minister is the Rev. James
Macdonald.</p>
<h4>Independent Chapel.</h4>
<p>This place of worship is situated on the west side of
Queen-street.&nbsp; It is a handsome brick building, having a
chaste stone front, with covered portico, and pillars of the
Grecian Doric order.&nbsp; It has galleries on three sides, and
will accommodate about 1,200 persons.&nbsp; It contains also a
good organ.&nbsp; The founders of this chapel were seceders from
the Presbyterian congregation in Crook-street, in consequence of
a departure from what they held as the principles of a sound
faith, as we have already noticed.&nbsp; For some years they
worshipped in a large room in Commonhall-street, afterwards
occupied by Mr. Wilcoxon&rsquo;s congregation.&nbsp; They formed
themselves into a church in 1772, when the Rev. Wm. Armitage was
chosen the pastor.&nbsp; The chapel in Queen-street was erected
in 1777; it was very much enlarged in 1838, when great
improvements were made in the arrangements of the interior.&nbsp;
At the same time a spacious wing was added to the building, which
is used as a lecture-room and as a sabbath school for girls:
underneath the lecture-room is a commodious sabbath school for
boys.&nbsp; In addition to the Sunday schools in Queen-street,
there are also three branch schools in the suburbs of the city,
which are supported by the congregation.&nbsp; The present
minister is the Rev. C. Chapman.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Wesleyan Methodist Chapel</span>.<br />
(<span class="GutSmall">OLD CONNEXION</span>.)</h4>
<p>This chapel (says Hemingway) was erected in 1811; it is a
large, well-built, handsome structure, with a semicircular front,
and two entrances.&nbsp; It is galleried on three sides, and
behind the pulpit is a large orchestra for the accommodation of
singers, where there is also a well-toned organ.&nbsp; The
introduction of Methodism into this city occurred about the year
1750, and the first preacher who visited the neighbourhood was a
Mr. John Bennett.&nbsp; He commenced his labours at Huntington
Hall, in the neighbourhood, the residence of Mr. George Cotton;
from thence the preaching was removed to the house of Mr. Richard
Jones, in Love-lane, within the city, where a society was first
formed; the house soon became too small for them, the society
therefore procured and fitted up a <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>capacious barn in Martin&rsquo;s Ash,
from which time they were regularly supplied with travelling
preachers, and where the Rev. John Wesley frequently visited
them, in his annual excursions.&nbsp; After remaining in
Martin&rsquo;s Ash for about twelve years, they had sufficient
credit to obtain &pound;520 upon bond, with which they erected,
in 1765, the Octagon Chapel in Foregate-street, which they
continued to occupy until their removal to St. John-street.&nbsp;
The Wesleyans have also built commodious schoolrooms, which are
very numerously attended.&nbsp; The resident ministers are the
Rev. T. Brooks and the Rev. J. E. Cooke.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Wesleyan Methodist Chapel</span>.<br />
(<span class="GutSmall">NEW CONNEXION</span>.)</h4>
<p>The New Connexion Methodists seceded from the old society on
some points respecting the management of the funds, throwing open
their financial matters to the knowledge and supervision of the
people, and the general government of their societies.&nbsp; They
have a large place of worship in Pepper-street, which is fronted
with stone, and supported by four Corinthian pillars.&nbsp; The
ministers are itinerant, and receive their appointment from the
annual conference.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Octagon Chapel</span></h4>
<p>is situated in Foregate-street, and, as already stated, was
built in 1765, by the Wesleyan Methodists.&nbsp; Upon their
removal to St. John-street, it was purchased, and has since that
time been occupied by its present possessors.&nbsp; The
congregation was collected by the labours of the late Rev. P.
Oliver, a clergyman of the Established Church, who embraced the
doctrines of the celebrated Mr. Whitefield.&nbsp; This gentleman
(says Hemingway, from whom we quote) converted some outbuildings
near his house in Boughton into a chapel, where he officiated
until his death without any other reward than the gratification
of diffusing among his poor neighbours, according to the best of
his judgment, the spirit and principles of evangelical
truth.&nbsp; At his death he bequeathed the chapel to his
congregation for a term of years; but upon their removal to the
Octagon, they sold their interest in it, and it has since been
occasionally used as a place of worship by the Independents of
Queen-street.&nbsp; The congregation at the Octagon is in
connection with the societies which were under the patronage of
the late Countess of Huntingdon.&nbsp; The present minister is
the Rev. W. Evans.</p>
<h4><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span><span
class="smcap">The Baptist Chapel</span></h4>
<p>is situated in Hamilton-place; it is a small brick building,
erected in 1806.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Welsh Calvinistic Chapel</span></h4>
<p>stands on the north side of Commonhall-street; it was opened
for public service on the 12th November, 1820.&nbsp; The public
service is conducted in the Welsh language.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Commonhall Street</span></h4>
<p>was erected in 1841, by the congregation of the late Mr.
Jonathan Wilcoxon, who officiated in an adjoining room, without
pecuniary emolument, for thirty-seven years.&nbsp; After his
death the congregation united themselves with the
Independents.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Quakers&rsquo; Meeting
House</span></h4>
<p>is a plain building, standing on the east side of
Frodsham-street.&nbsp; It is capable of containing several
hundred persons, and has a burial ground in front; it is one of
the oldest dissenting places of worship now existing in
Chester.&nbsp; Clarkson, in his &lsquo;Memoirs of William
Penn,&rsquo; says, &ldquo;Among the places he (William Penn)
visited in Cheshire, was Chester itself.&nbsp; The king (James
the Second), who was then travelling, arriving there at the same
time, went to the <i>Meeting House</i> of the Quakers to hear him
preach.&rdquo;&nbsp; In George Fox&rsquo;s journal, there is an
entry which proves that the Quakers have existed as a distinct
society in Chester for about 200 years.&nbsp; Under date 1657, he
writes: &ldquo;From Wrexham we came to west Chester, and it being
the fair time, we staid there awhile and <i>visited
Friends</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The resident members of this society
are now very few, and the service is seldom performed.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Primitive Methodists</span></h4>
<p>have a small chapel in Steam-Mill-street, erected about the
year 1825, and the members of the society appear to be on the
increase.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Roman Catholic Chapel</span></h4>
<p>is situated on the west side of Queen-street.&nbsp; It is a
small but good brick building, with a Doric portico, supported by
four light stone pillars in front, and was built in 1799.&nbsp;
The chapel is now found to be too small for the congregation, and
the erection of a <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>larger edifice is contemplated, when the requisite funds
can be provided.&nbsp; The Rev. J. Carberry is the present priest
in residence.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">The Presbyterian Chapel</span></h4>
<p>is situated in Pepper-street.&nbsp; It was erected, in 1827,
by the Baptists, but the congregation becoming very small, it was
closed some years ago.&nbsp; In 1846 it was reopened for
Presbyterian worship, and has continued to be occupied by a small
but respectable society.&nbsp; The Rev. W. Hunter is the
minister.</p>
<h3>ENDOWED AND CHARITABLE SCHOOLS.</h3>
<h4><span class="smcap">The King&rsquo;s School</span>.</h4>
<p>This school was founded by King Henry the Eighth, in the
thirty-sixth year of his reign, for twenty-four boys to receive
&pound;3 4s. each, who are appointed by the Dean and
Chapter.&nbsp; By the charter it is ordained, &ldquo;that there
shall ever be in our church of Chester twenty-four boys, poor and
friendless, to be maintained out of the income of our church, of
good capacities and given to learning if possible; which,
however, we would not have admitted before they can read and
write, and somewhat understand the rudiments of grammar; and this
at the discretion of the Dean and Head Master.&nbsp; And these
boys we will have maintained at the expense of our church until
they have made some tolerable proficiency in the Latin grammar,
and have been taught to write and speak Latin, for which end they
are allowed the term of four years, or, if the Dean or Head
Master see cause, of five and no more.&nbsp; But we order that no
one, unless he be a chorister of our church, be elected a poor
scholar that is under the age of nine years.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some
important alterations have recently been made in the management
of the school, which have very considerably increased its
efficiency.&nbsp; We are happy to find that the inhabitants of
Chester are availing themselves of the great advantages provided
by this excellent institution.&nbsp; The course of instruction
has been made such as to qualify the scholars for any of the
literary professions or commercial pursuits, embracing as it does
all the elements of a sound mathematical, classical, and general
education.&nbsp; The Head Master is the Rev. J. Harris,
M.A.&nbsp; The chorister boys are educated apart, by a master
expressly appointed for that purpose by the Dean and Chapter.</p>
<h4><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span><span
class="smcap">The Diocesan School</span>.</h4>
<p>This institution was established, January 2, 1812, by public
subscription, under the patronage of the Bishop of Chester.&nbsp;
It is situated on the south side of the top of George-street, is
80 feet long by 33 wide, and is capable of accommodating 400
children.&nbsp; It is supported by benefactions and annual
subscriptions, and the institution is in a most prosperous
condition; its object is to promote a good education among the
children of the poor.&nbsp; The present master is Mr. Beswick,
who is efficiently fulfilling the duties of his office.</p>
<p>There are also the Blue Coat School, established by Bishop
Stratford, in 1700; the Blue Girls&rsquo; School, established in
1721; Infant schools, established in 1825, under the patronage of
Bishop Blomfield; Diocesan Training College, erected in 1742, of
which the Principal is the Rev. Arthur Rigg, M.A.</p>

EATON HALL.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> the visitor leaves Chester,
we have no doubt he will be induced to visit Eaton Hall, the
princely mansion of the Marquis of Westminster, which is situated
in a beautiful park, about three miles to the south of
Chester.&nbsp; The principal approach to the house is through the
Chester gateway&mdash;a fine building, situated within a short
distance of the city.&nbsp; The design is a spirited copy of St.
Augustine&rsquo;s Abbey Gate, Canterbury, by T. Jones, Esq.,
architect, of Chester, who has added appropriate wings and wing
walls, after the style of architecture in the thirteenth
century.&nbsp; The approach is from a noble esplanade, about 200
feet long by 100 feet broad, at the further end of which the
lodge is entered through a pointed arch and groining, enriched
with groups of very delicate foliage.&nbsp; Each side of the
archway is defended by an octagonal tower, 50 feet high, rising
about 12 feet above the centre of the edifice.&nbsp; The lower
parts of the towers, with the wings, are comparatively plain; the
centre of them is enriched with niches, surmounted by bunches of
foliage exquisitely carved; the upper part is richly panelled and
pierced, which, combined with the battlements, produces a light
effect.&nbsp; The middle, above the archway and between the
towers, is enriched with two windows, surrounded by elegant
mouldings, with a central niche containing the Westminster arms,
supported by the talbots in grand relief.&nbsp; Above the windows
are a series of grotesque heads and fretwork, surrounded with an
enriched battlement.&nbsp; The sides of the upper part are
carried through in the same style, but not so highly
enriched.&nbsp; The lodge or wing portions have a window in
front, surmounted with a cornice and an appropriate battlement,
having angular buttresses.&nbsp; The inner front on the Eaton
side is ornamented in the same manner.&nbsp; To the sides are
attached wing walls, extending 60 feet, pierced with loopholes
and embattled, forming a grand <i>tout ensemble</i>.</p>
<p>The present magnificent edifice, the designs for which were <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>furnished by
Porden, was erected upon the site of the old hall (a stately
brick mansion, built by Sir John Vanburgh, taken down in 1803),
and is considered the most splendid modern specimen of the
pointed Gothic in the kingdom.&nbsp; Although in the general
design the florid Gothic order of the time of Edward the Third
has been followed, the architect has, in parts, not only availed
himself of the low Tudor arch, but has adopted the peculiar style
of any period suitable to his purpose, and has made subservient
to modern domestic convenience the rich and varied forms in which
our ancient ecclesiastical architecture abounds.&nbsp; The walls,
battlements, and pinnacles of the building are constructed of
stone of a light and beautiful colour, brought from Delamere
Forest; and round the turrets and in various parts of the
parapets are shields, charged in relief with the heraldic
achievements of the house of Grosvenor, and of other ancient
families with whom they are allied.&nbsp; The building consists
of a centre and two wings, the latter differing from each other
somewhat in design; of these, that to the south, composed of two
compartments, is the more beautiful; this wing is oblong and
angular, with four octagonal turrets at the corners, buttresses
at the sides, and having the embattled parapets surmounted with
pinnacles; the decorations are rich to profusion, but every part
accords with the original plan.&nbsp; The eastern and western
fronts agree in their general form and proportions, but the
former possesses the greater number of minute decorations.&nbsp;
In the front a cloister extends along the entire length between
the two spacious windows of the dining and drawing rooms, and
conducts to the terrace: from the terrace, which is 350 feet
long, the view is eminently beautiful.&nbsp; The groves and
gardens, with the conservatory, form the foreground; beyond them
is seen the noble inlet of the Dee, and a charming extensive
landscape fills up the distance.&nbsp; The view from the gardens
embraces the south or library wing, but the opposite extremity is
partly hidden by the trees; beyond it, but apparently mingling
with the turrets and pinnacles, is seen a lofty octagonal
clock-tower, connected by flying buttresses with four slender
shafts on a square basement; it is attached to part of the stable
court, which recedes from the line of the east front, and which
is of great extent.</p>
<p>The principal entrance is on the western front, under a lofty
portico, the clustered pillars of which support a beautifully
groined ceiling; from this a flight of steps leads to a pair of
massive bronzed doors, admitting to the grand entrance hall,
which is <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>elegant and lofty, occupying the height of two stories;
it is 41 feet long and 31 feet in breadth, and has a groined
ceiling, embellished with the armorial bearings of the house of
Grosvenor, and other devices in the bosses that cover the
juncture of the ribs.&nbsp; The branching compartments terminate
in a rich centre-piece, from which is suspended a beautiful lamp,
which, when lighted, gives the pavement, composed of the choicest
marbles, a gorgeous effect: the floor was laid down at a cost of
1,600 guineas.&nbsp; The screen at the end of the hall is
decorated with shields of arms, and consists of five arches,
which support a gallery connecting the sleeping apartments on the
north and south sides of the house, which are separated by the
elevation of the hall.&nbsp; In lofty canopied recesses at the
sides of the hall, are four complete suits of ancient armour; and
beneath the gallery two open arches, to the right and left,
conduct to the grand staircase and the state bed-room.&nbsp;
Through a pair of massive, richly carved, mahogany folding-doors,
which cost 100 guineas each, the visitor is ushered into the
saloon, which forms the centre of a suite of apartments of
unequalled beauty and magnificence.&nbsp; The groined and fretted
ceilings of these rooms, decorated with the endless ramifications
of fanwork tracery and the most beautiful varieties of Gothic
foliage, brilliant in colour, and rich with the herald&rsquo;s
skill, yet chastened by the direction of an exquisite taste, and
subdued by the propriety of the arrangement&mdash;the walls
beautified in the richest style of decoration, receiving and
reflecting still more glowing hues as the sunbeams stream through
the painted glass with which the windows are profusely
ornamented&mdash;the paintings of the highest
excellence&mdash;the chandeliers of elaborate
workmanship&mdash;the gorgeous furniture corresponding with the
house&mdash;the cabinets of Mosaic ivory and pearl&mdash;the
golden vases sparkling in the niche&mdash;in short, the whole
finishing and furnishing of these apartments constitute a
combination of costliness and good taste which justly commands
the admiration of every visitor.</p>
<p>The <i>saloon</i> is a splendid apartment; it is a square of
30 feet, formed into an octagon by arches across the angles,
which give to the vaultings a beautiful form; there are three
windows, enriched with tracery, and nearly filled with painted
glass, through which a subdued light is admitted, giving to the
Gothic character of the saloon a very rich and striking
effect.&nbsp; The elegant fan tracery of the ceiling is supported
by twelve slender columns in the angles and sides; the Roman
circle, forming the centre, is composed of <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>numerous
mouldings, and ornamented with fruit and foliage.&nbsp; The
stained glass windows represent the heraldic achievements of the
noble house of Grosvenor, with those of the ancient families with
whom they have formed alliances; and in the upper compartments
are six full-length figures of William the Conqueror; Sir Gilbert
le Grosvenor, his companion at the time of the Norman invasion,
and the nephew of Hugh Lupus; the lady of Sir Gilbert; Sir Robert
le Grosvenor, the Crusader; Joan Lady Grosvenor, heiress of
Eaton; and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, uncle of the Conqueror.&nbsp;
The furniture of the room is chaste, both in colour and
design.&nbsp; The chimney-piece is of statuary marble, and
opposite to it is an organ, both highly adorned.&nbsp; This room
has recently been richly decorated in the Alhambresque style, by
Mr. John Morris of Chester; each panel being most beautifully
embellished with landscapes.</p>
<p>The ante-rooms, though of similar proportions, are differently
decorated; the ceiling of each is covered with a delicate pattern
of tracery, and both are superbly furnished.&nbsp; The windows
are composed of stained glass, representing the figures and arms
of six of the Earls of Chester.</p>
<p>The ante-dining-room is a handsome apartment, recently
decorated in the Alhambresque style, by Mr. Morris, though with
less elaborate finish than the saloon.</p>
<p>The dining-room is well proportioned, being 50 feet by 37
feet.&nbsp; The simplicity of its design is not owing to any
deficiency of ornament; on the contrary, its several enrichments
are gorgeous; but in comparison with the other state apartments,
which are profusely decorated, it is characterized by a
simplicity peculiarly elegant.&nbsp; Springing from the corners
of the room, four ribs extend their ramified tracery over the
ceiling, in the centre of which their borders of wreathed foliage
unite, and thence from a richly carved boss is suspended a large
and noble chandelier.&nbsp; The sideboard stands in an arched and
highly enriched recess, and placed at each end of the room are
two canopied niches, containing statues by
<i>Westmacott</i>.&nbsp; At the lower end are those of Sir Robert
le Grosvenor, who distinguished himself in the crusades, and of
Mary, Lady Grosvenor at the time of the Revolution.&nbsp; Those
at the upper end of the room represent Sir Gilbert le Grosvenor,
who came over from France at the time of the Norman invasion,
with his uncle, Hugh Lupus, and Joan or Jane Lady Grosvenor,
heiress of Eaton in the reign of Edward the Fourth.&nbsp; The
room contains full-length portraits of the late Marquis and
Marchioness of Westminster, by <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span><i>Jackson</i>, <i>R.A.</i>; Abigail
meeting David, by <i>Rubens</i>; and the Judgment of Paris, after
Rubens, by <i>Peters</i>.&nbsp; The walls of the dining-room are
richly ornamented.</p>
<p>The ante-drawing-room is very elegant; its decorations, in the
Alhambresque style, are peculiarly rich.&nbsp; It contains three
most beautiful bookcases, chaste in design and exquisitely
finished.</p>
<p>The drawing-room has four magnificent niches, and a noble
window with a lofty pointed arch and tracery of rich and
beautiful forms, adorned with stained glass.&nbsp; It is placed
at the end opposite the entrance, and commands a fine prospect,
the inlet of the Dee forming a conspicuous object in the
landscape.&nbsp; The pattern of the ceiling, which is decorated
with compartments numerously subdivided and intersected, is
formed in four divisions issuing from clustered pillars with
foliated capitals, and united in the centre to an hexagonal
frame, elaborately reticulated, from which issues a pendant of
foliage sustaining a superb chandelier of crystal.&nbsp; The
number and variety of the carved knots and foliage add to the
beauty of the ceiling; but the decorations that increase its
effect, and are indeed its most prominent attractions, are the
shields on which the heraldic achievements of the various
branches of the Grosvenor family are emblazoned.&nbsp; The pale
hue of the ceiling, the gorgeous decorations in the centre, and
the rich glow of the crimson velvet with which the walls of this
noble apartment are covered, all combine to render it a scene of
unsurpassed magnificence.&nbsp; Corresponding in costly
embellishment with its architecture is the furniture, of blue
satin, fringed with yellow silk, crimson velvet, and damask
satin.&nbsp; Over the chimney-piece, which is carved in statuary
marble, is a lofty mirror in an arched frame, sufficiently broad
to admit a pattern of tracery, on the compartments of which
crimson velvet is introduced with happy effect.&nbsp; This
splendid apartment contains the following pictures:&mdash;Judith
with the head of Holofernes, <i>Guercino</i>&mdash;Reuben showing
to Jacob the bloody garment of his son Joseph, also by
<i>Guercino</i>&mdash;Antiochus and Stratonice, <i>Pietro de
Cortona</i>&mdash;Christ and the Woman of Samaria,
<i>Mignard</i>&mdash;Jacob blessing Ephraim and Manasseh,
<i>West</i>&mdash;Elijah raising the Widow&rsquo;s Son, also by
<i>West</i>.</p>
<p>The library comprehends the whole of the south wing, and is
the most spacious room in the mansion; it varies in breadth, but
is 120 feet long.&nbsp; The bookcases are of rich carved oak, and
the windows are ornamented with tracery and stained glass.&nbsp;
When the door is thrown open, the view from the further end of
the <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>library is continued through the vaulted corridor at
the opposite extremity of the house, a length of 480 feet.&nbsp;
A very rare piece of antiquity is preserved in the library, it is
a gold torque, an ornament of dignity worn by the ancient
Britons; it is wreathed, the rods are linked together in a
circle, and it measures 10 or 11 inches in diameter.&nbsp; The
library contains many most valuable and rare books and MSS.,
among which may be mentioned&mdash;a copy of the chronicle of
Henry of Huntingdon, in which is a curious drawing of the entry
of King Stephen into Lincoln; an illuminated MS. on vellum,
containing the proceedings of the celebrated suit of arms between
Scroope and Grosvenor; and (among other Cheshire MSS.) one volume
of collections, containing a transcript of a large portion of the
celebrated and lost record, distinguished by the name of
&ldquo;The Cheshire Doomsday;&rdquo; also the confirmation
charter of Chester Cathedral, by the second Ranulf, surnamed De
Gernon or Gernons, Earl of Chester, in which the grant of Hugh
Lupus is recapitulated.</p>
<p>The great staircase is very richly decorated: at the top of
the first flight of stairs are three niches with statues.&nbsp;
On the opposite side, at the foot of the stairs, is an arcade
supporting the upper floor; and from these arches, which have
open spandrils, the best view of this magnificent staircase is
obtained.</p>
<p>The state bed-room is an elegant apartment; the ceiling is
vaulted, and the bed is of mahogany, and groined; its principal
carved ornaments appear on clustered pillars, detached from the
corners.&nbsp; The sofas are of blue satin, in richly carved and
gilt frames, and the other seats are covered in finely-wrought
needlework of various colours.&nbsp; Over the chimney-piece is a
mirror, the frame of which is composed of handsomely-clustered
pillars, pinnacles, and crocketed canopies, the whole being
richly decorated with gilding, and minutely carved.</p>
<p>The tenants&rsquo; hall is under the library, and corresponds
with it in extent.&nbsp; The windows are enriched with tracery,
and four massive clustered pillars sustain the arches and groins
of the ceding, which is remarkably flat, when the breadth of its
span is taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The chapel is a small, beautifully-proportioned edifice.&nbsp;
The windows are beautifully ornamented with stained glass, the
work of Mr. Ballantine, of Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The east front of the hall is adorned with a raised terrace,
from whence, sloping to an extensive piece of water, and
intersected by <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>walks, extend the flower gardens and pleasure grounds,
which cover a space of 50 acres.&nbsp; The extensive pleasure
grounds and gardens are laid out with admirable taste; the
conservatory, recently erected, is a most beautiful construction,
and forms an attractive object.&nbsp; At the termination of a
fine gravel walk, and opposite to the conservatory, a Gothic
temple has been built for the reception of a Roman altar,
discovered near Chester, 1821.&nbsp; The Mosaic pavement of the
temple was brought from a palace of the Emperor Tiberius, in the
island of Caprie, by Lord Robert Grosvenor.</p>
<p>The stables, which form a large quadrangle on the north side
of the hall, are erected in a style of architecture correspondent
with that of the house, and are separated from it by a small
shrubbery.</p>
<p>An elegant iron bridge of 150 feet span, crossing the river
Dee, which runs through a part of the grounds, is likewise a real
embellishment to the landscape.&nbsp; This bridge is exceedingly
ornamental; it was erected by Hazledine, at an expense of about
&pound;8,000.&nbsp; From each point by which Eaton Hall is
approached, it presents a picture of unusual architectural
grandeur: the scenery by which the hall is surrounded heightens
the effect; westward, the view embraces the mountains of Wales;
and to the east appear the Peckforton hills, with the bold rock
on which stand the ruins of Beeston Castle.&nbsp; The river Dee,
winding in various directions, imparts great beauty to the varied
and extensive landscape.</p>
<p>The noble house of Grosvenor traces its descent through a long
line of illustrious ancestors, who flourished in Normandy with
dignity and splendour, from the time it was created a sovereign
Dukedom, in the year 912, to the conquest of England in 1066,
always ranking with the first nobles, and having had the
government of many castles and strongholds in that Duchy.&nbsp;
The founder of this ancient house was uncle of Rollo, the famous
Dane, and was one of the principal commanders who, in the year
876, accompanied him in his invasion of England.&nbsp; William,
seventh Duke of Normandy, at the time of his descent upon
England, in 1066, was accompanied by his twin brother Robert,
afterwards Earl of Cornwall, and Odo, Bishop of Bayeux,
afterwards Earl of Kent; he had also, for his immediate
attendants, his nephew, Hugh Lupus, afterwards Earl of Chester,
and Gilbert le Grosvenor, nephew to Hugh.</p>
<p>The present Marquis succeeded to the title in 1845, and is the
<a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>twenty-second in descent from Gilbert le Grosvenor, the
companion in arms of William the Conqueror.&nbsp; His lordship,
who holds the office of Lord-Lieutenant of Cheshire, married, in
1819, Elizabeth Mary, youngest daughter of the Duke of
Sutherland, and has, with other issue, a son and heir, Hugh
Lupus, Earl Grosvenor, one of the representatives in Parliament
for Chester, for which so many members of this illustrious house
have been elected.</p>
<p>Admission to visit Eaton Hall can only be obtained by tickets,
which may be had of the principal booksellers, and at the hotels,
at fixed prices; the proceeds being distributed by the Marquis of
Westminster to public charities.</p>

<h3>ECCLESTON</h3>
<p>is a beautiful little village, about two miles from Chester,
much resorted to by the inhabitants of that city, and by
strangers, from its vicinity to Eaton Hall.&nbsp; The chief
object of attraction is the church, built in 1810 by the late
Marquis of Westminster.&nbsp; The interior of the church is
chaste and handsome; in the north transept is the mausoleum of
the Eaton family, and opposite to it their pew: over the altar is
a fine painting, by Westall, of the Dead Christ.</p>

105</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
THE GENERAL RAILWAY STATION</h2>
<p>is situated in Flookersbrook, and is the terminus of five
different lines of railway&mdash;viz., the London and North
Western; the Chester and Holyhead; the Chester and Mold; the
Birkenhead, Lancashire, and Cheshire Junction; and the Great
Western: four of which companies contributed, in rateable
proportions, towards the erection of the building.&nbsp; It is
one of the most extensive railway establishments in the kingdom,
and the works comprise a large and elegant passenger and arrival
shed, with all suitable offices, and adjoining which is a most
commodious spare carriage shed, a goods dep&ocirc;t, gas works,
water works, and three engine sheds.&nbsp; The whole was designed
by C. H. Wild, Esq., C.E., and Mr. Thompson, of London, and
carried out under the supervision of Robert Stephenson, Esq.,
C.E., M.P.</p>
<p><i>The Passenger Shed</i> occupies a space of ground nearly a
quarter of a mile in length, and presents to the city an elegant
fa&ccedil;ade 1,010 feet long, or a frontage, including the house
and carriage landings, of 1,160 feet.&nbsp; It is built of
dark-coloured bricks, relieved with copings and facings of
Stourton stone.&nbsp; At each end of the station, and projecting
from the main building, there is a shed for the arrival of
trains, each 290 feet long by 24 feet broad, covered with an iron
roof; in these sheds cabs and omnibuses await the arrival of all
trains.</p>
<p>On the inner side of the building is the General Departure
Platform, extending 740 feet in length by 20 feet in width; this
and three lines of rails is covered with an exceedingly chaste
and elegant iron roof, of 60 feet span, designed and carried out
by C. H. Wild, Esq., C.E.&nbsp; Behind this shed again, but
visible from the general platform through the arches, is the
spare carriage shed, 600 feet long by 52 feet broad.&nbsp; The
whole arrangements of the buildings are admirably adapted to
carry on, with comfort to the public and with facility to the
<i>employ&eacute;s</i>, the immense business that has so <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>suddenly
been brought to the city by the convergence of so many railways
at this point.</p>
<p><i>The Goods Dep&ocirc;t</i> is situated immediately behind
the passengers&rsquo; building, and fully accords with it in
style.&nbsp; It consists of a shed, 180 feet long and 120 feet
wide, with four railway entrances; and containing three platforms
or decks, furnished with 18 cranes and light weighing machines,
and the waggons are run alongside the decks to receive or
discharge their loads.</p>
<p>The extent of land purchased by the general station committee
for station purposes is about 75 acres; and within the station
precincts there are more than 7 miles of railway line, with 51
turntables.&nbsp; The gross cost of the land and buildings has
been about &pound;240,000.&nbsp; A spacious hotel will soon be
erected on the land opposite to the station.</p>
<p>The affairs of the station are superintended by a committee of
8 gentlemen, who are elected from the boards of the four
contributing companies, and their views are carried out by their
manager and secretary, R. L. Jones, Esq., who has so well
organized his large staff of officers and men, that the arduous
and responsible duties devolving upon him are performed, not only
with the greatest efficiency, but also with a most satisfactory
courtesy and convenience to the public.</p>

<p>This remarkably successful machine has now been before the
public for some years, during which time it has received the most
distinguished honours that could be awarded&mdash;the First
Prizes of all the National Societies, and the highest
commendations of the Judges of all the principal Societies in
Great Britain.&nbsp; In testing the comparative value of
machinery the first consideration is, the power required to work
the same: in other words, the power required to overcome the
friction of the different parts of the machinery.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">Richmond &amp; Chandler</span> beg to observe that
the utmost attention is given to the fitting and the perfecting
of all the working parts of their machines, which they are
determined shall continue to maintain their high position and
well-earned celebrity.&nbsp; On the trial of Chaff Cutters, the
following report is found in the leading journal:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;CHAFF-CUTTING ENGINES.&mdash;In this class
of implements, Messrs. Richmond and Chandler have surpassed
everything that has been produced before, inasmuch as their new
machine does the same amount of work, with 45 per cent. less
power, in the same time, thereby reducing the expense of this
important operation.&nbsp; Choking in the feed&mdash;an evil to
which the best of these machines have hitherto been more or less
liable&mdash;is scarcely possible, from the form of toothed
rollers applied.&nbsp; Altogether the getting up is well worthy
the reputation of the inventors.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The true and <i>unsolicited</i> testimonial here given more
than confirms the above report of the <i>Times</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To Messrs. Richmond and Chandler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&mdash;I herewith enclose you a cheque for
the amount of your Chaff Cutter, No. 4.&nbsp; I had the
opportunity of putting it to a strong test throughout the winter,
and have much pleasure to inform you that it has given me perfect
satisfaction.&nbsp; I had been in the habit of using a machine
for years that had obtained a high degree of celebrity with the
Royal Agricultural Association, but I was obliged to get rid of
it on account of the amount of labour it required, and the
impossibility of making it feed itself.&nbsp; All these
objections are fully obviated by your machine.&nbsp; A neighbour
of mine has another of them, and he is equally pleased with
his.&nbsp; I remain, gentlemen, yours, &amp;c.,</p>

GREAT BOTANIC MEDICINE.</h3>
<p style="text-align: center">DR. TORRENS&rsquo; PURE HERBAL
PILLS.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>No language can convey an adequate idea of the immediate and
almost miraculous change produced by making use of these Pills in
the diseased, debilitated, and shattered nervous system.&nbsp; To
print all the letters of thanks received from different
individuals, describing the great benefit received by making use
of this medicine, would fill a book larger than the Bible!&nbsp;
The relaxed and debilitated body and nerves are at once rebraced,
restored, enlivened, and built up.&nbsp; The mental and physical
symptoms of all disease vanish together under its
influence&mdash;the stooping trembling victim of depression or
debility becomes a new man; he stands erect; he moves with a firm
step; his mind, which was previously sunk in gloom, becomes
bright, buoyant, active, and he goes forth refreshed,
regenerated, and conscious of new vigour, to his accustomed
occupation.&nbsp; And the effect is not temporary; on the
contrary, the relief is permanent; for the cordial properties of
the medicine reach the constitution itself, and restores it to
its first condition.&nbsp; Well may this preparation be called
the Medical Wonder of the nineteenth century.&nbsp; It is,
indeed, that miracle of medicine that stimulates without
producing a corresponding depression.&nbsp; In all diseases of
the stomach and digestive organs it never fails, and by setting
the stomach to rights, all the other functions of the body are
sure to be set to rights also.&nbsp; In cases of headache,
vertigo, pain in the face and nerves, and all the varied train of
nervous affections, these pills perform a cure in an astonishing
short period of time.&nbsp; They also remove depression,
excitement, restlessness, want of sleep, a dislike to society,
incapacity for business, loss of memory, confusion, giddiness,
blood in the head, melancholy, mental debility, hysteria,
indecision, wretchedness, &amp;c.&nbsp; They increase and restore
the appetite, strengthen the emaciated, renew the health of those
who have destroyed it, cause a continued cheerfulness, and
prolong life to the latest possible period.</p>
<p>The following Testimonial of the great value of TORRENS&rsquo;
HERBAL PILLS is taken out of thousands:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;To the Proprietor
of Torrens&rsquo; Herbal Pills.<br />
53, Church-street, Blackburn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;I have just received the twelve dozen of Dr.
Torrens&rsquo; Herbal Pills, which I am happy to observe are
going off in a very satisfactory manner.&nbsp; Since I last wrote
you, I have had frequent testimonials from various persons, old
and young, of their beneficial effects&mdash;several of whom have
stated that they consider the Herbal Pills not only an excellent
medicine for correcting vicious humours in the system, but also
efficacious in purifying the blood, relieving the liver,
cleansing the intestines, and producing vigorous reaction in the
whole arterial system.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Yours faithfully, <span
class="smcap">Charles Tiplady</span>, Bookseller.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><sup>*</sup><sub>*</sub><sup>*</sup> Parties desirous of
selling Torrens&rsquo; Herbal Pills can be supplied, at wholesale
prices, by Messrs. Parry and Son, Booksellers, Chester; or from
any of the Wholesale Houses.&nbsp; Sold also by Mrs. Dutton, City
Walls.</p>
<p>Should the reader find any difficulty in procuring a box of
Dr. Torrens&rsquo; Pills, he can send 15 postage stamps to
Richard Brook, Printer, Buxton-road, Huddersfield, when a box
will be returned by post to any part of the Kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> returning her grateful thanks
for the patronage and support which she has received during the
last fifteen years,</p>
<p style="text-align: center">MISS ROBERTS</p>
<p>begs to inform her friends and the public, that during the
winter season she has added to the comforts and accommodation at
&ldquo;THE GEORGE,&rdquo; on a scale calculated to meet its
present requirements.</p>
<p>Among the buildings now added to &ldquo;THE GEORGE,&rdquo; is
a <span class="smcap">New Coffee Room</span>, on a magnificent
scale; adjoining which, and fitted up in a style appropriate for
<i>evening reception</i>, is an <span class="smcap">Octagonal
Drawing-Room</span> of corresponding proportions.&nbsp; Above is
a new range of <span class="smcap">Sleeping Apartments</span>,
which enables Miss Roberts to make up <i>forty additional
beds</i>.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Stables</span> have been much enlarged
and improved; the <span class="smcap">Carriage</span> and <span
class="smcap">Posting</span> departments having, at the same
time, undergone thorough revision.</p>
<p>Additional <span class="smcap">Hot</span> and <span
class="smcap">Cold Baths</span> have been built, and are always
ready.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sea-Bathing</span> may be enjoyed at the
foot of the grounds.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Omnibuses</span> from &ldquo;THE
GEORGE&rdquo; meet every train at Bangor Station.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Liverpool Steamers</span> ply to and from
Bangor Ferry daily.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Pleasure</span> and <span
class="smcap">Sailing Boats</span> are in constant attendance,
and the Sea Fishing in the Straits opposite the house seldom
fails to afford sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;THE GEORGE&rdquo; is lighted by gas manufactured for
its sole use, and free from any impurity.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Two Tables d&rsquo;H&ocirc;te</span> are
served daily; one at 3, and the other at 6, <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span></p>
<p>The House is, as usual, supplied with Wines of the first
class.</p>
<p>The growing necessity which Miss Roberts has of late
experienced for more ample accommodation, to meet the
requirements of the increased numbers who honour her house with
their patronage, has induced her, at a very large outlay, to
perfect her present arrangements; and she ventures to express a
hope that the spacious and well-appointed Apartments which have
formed part of her plan, will now be found sufficient for a
demand which for some time past it has been difficult fully to
provide for.</p>

to R. G. and <span class="smcap">Sons</span>&rsquo; well-known
Implement, which has now been before the Public upwards of
fourteen years, taking the <span class="smcap">First Prize at

competitors, and has earned for itself a reputation such as no

important when it is borne in mind that no <i>further

sufficient proof of the high estimation in which they are held,

<p>This Machine took the First Prize at the Royal Agricultural

and at Carlisle, 1855, was awarded the Honorary Silver Medal,
with a High Commendation, for the introduction of a Patent
Apparatus for Separating the Corn and Delivering it in Sacks
ready for Market.&nbsp; This is an object often attempted, but
never before effectually accomplished by a Portable
Machine.&nbsp; As a proof of the superiority of C., S., &amp;
Co.&rsquo;s Combined Thrashing Machines over all others, they
think the following extract, copied from the Judge&rsquo;s Report
of the Royal Agricultural Society&rsquo;s Meeting, held at
Lincoln, 1854, is sufficient to establish their well-earned
reputation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Not long since the farmer was satisfied to
thrash an increased quantity of corn by the application of steam
power to the old thrashing box.&nbsp; Soon he finds he must have
his corn partially dressed; but now he must have it finished,
sacked, and weighed for market.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For these last improvements we are much indebted to
Messrs. Clayton and Shuttleworth; and here I must remark that
they were rather in advance of the Society, for they brought out
their finishing Machine at Lewes previously to a prize being
offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Portable Thrashing Machines</i>, <i>not exceeding
Eight Horse Power</i>, <i>with Straw Shaker</i>, <i>Riddle</i>,
<i>and Winnower</i>, <i>that will best prepare for the finishing
Dressing Machine&mdash;to be driven by Steam</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prize of &pound;20 was awarded to Messrs. Clayton
and Shuttleworth, the performances of whose Machine were, on the
whole, superior to any other, and its construction inferior to
none.&rdquo;</p>

report&mdash;&ldquo;Too much can scarcely be said in its praise,
for it was next to impossible for a machine to thrash and dress
corn in a better manner.&nbsp; There was neither tail corn
amongst the best, nor best corn amongst the tail; and the latter
was again separated into marketable, chicken corn, whites, seeds,
&amp;c., each delivered into sacks from separate
spouts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The above Engraving represents a Six-horse Power Horizontal
Cylinder Steam Engine, erected complete upon metal foundation
plate, which arrangement renders it easy of removal&mdash;an
important point to a Tenant Farmer.&nbsp; The principle of this
Engine is direct action, which simplifies the whole arrangement,
inasmuch as the working parts are fewer in number, more compact,
and less likely to get out of repair.&nbsp; Being secured upon
one bedplate renders it unnecessary to have any bearings or
fastenings in the partition or adjoining walls of the building in
which it is inclosed.</p>
<p>It is supplied with Cylindrical Cornish Boiler of ample size
and strength, the whole being made of the very best material,
fitted and finished in a style equal to any house in the
trade.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;As different situations, in almost every case,
involve special arrangements, C. S., &amp; Co. will be happy to
furnish Plans and Specifications where fixed machinery is
required.</p>

<p>This is the Machine that took the &pound;5 prize against Mr.
Nicholson&rsquo;s Haymaker, at the <span class="smcap">Great
Waterford Trial</span>, last August (1857), immediately after the
Salisbury Show.&nbsp; The above trial was conducted under the
direction of the same Judge who was engaged at the Royal
Society&rsquo;s Trials at Salisbury.&nbsp; The circumstance
proves that Smith and Ashby&rsquo;s Machine is the best Haymaker
in use.&nbsp; This celebrated Machine has taken Thirty-one
First-class Prizes, and has stood the test of twelve years.</p>
<p>N.B.&mdash;S. &amp; A. are now constructing all their
Haymakers on their original patent principle, and exactly like
the one that took the Prize at Waterford; and they warrant every
Machine they send out.&nbsp; Price &pound;15 15s.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
